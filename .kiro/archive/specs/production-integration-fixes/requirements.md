# Production Integration Fixes - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Codebase Gardener system currently has critical integration issues between its core components that prevent proper project switching and AI model loading. Load testing reveals that while projects can be registered, they cannot be properly utilized by the AI/ML subsystems, resulting in "Project not found" errors across multiple components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Component Synchronization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all system components to be properly synchronized when a project is registered, so that I can immediately use AI features without integration failures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a project is registered THEN the project registry SHALL notify all dependent components
2. WHEN a project is registered THEN the vector store manager SHALL create the project's vector store
3. WHEN a project is registered THEN the model loader SHALL prepare the project's adapter configuration
4. WHEN a project is registered THEN the context manager SHALL initialize the project's context
5. IF any component fails during registration THEN the system SHALL rollback all changes and report the specific failure

### Requirement 2: Project Lifecycle Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper project lifecycle management so that projects are consistently available across all system components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a project is created THEN all components SHALL be initialized in the correct order
2. WHEN a project is deleted THEN all components SHALL be cleaned up in reverse order
3. WHEN a project is switched THEN all components SHALL transition to the new project state
4. WHEN a component fails to initialize THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with remediation steps
5. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL verify all registered projects are accessible by all components

### Requirement 3: Integration Health Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to continuously monitor integration health so that I can detect and fix issues before they impact users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL perform integration health checks on all registered projects
2. WHEN a project operation fails THEN the system SHALL log detailed diagnostic information
3. WHEN integration issues are detected THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic remediation
4. WHEN automatic remediation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific manual remediation steps
5. WHEN load testing runs THEN it SHALL verify actual project functionality, not just registration success

### Requirement 4: Robust Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to gracefully handle component failures and provide clear guidance on resolution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a component is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue operating with reduced functionality
2. WHEN a project cannot be loaded THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options
3. WHEN integration errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages
4. WHEN components recover THEN the system SHALL automatically restore full functionality
5. WHEN errors persist THEN the system SHALL guide users through manual recovery procedures

### Requirement 5: Load Testing Accuracy

**User Story:** As a developer, I want load testing to accurately reflect real system behavior so that I can trust performance metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN load testing creates projects THEN it SHALL verify they are accessible by all components
2. WHEN load testing measures success rates THEN it SHALL test actual AI functionality, not just registration
3. WHEN load testing reports metrics THEN they SHALL reflect real user experience
4. WHEN load testing fails THEN it SHALL provide specific component-level failure details
5. WHEN load testing completes THEN it SHALL clean up all test artifacts without affecting production data

### Requirement 6: Component Interface Standardization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want standardized interfaces between components so that integration issues are minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components communicate THEN they SHALL use standardized project identifiers
2. WHEN components are initialized THEN they SHALL follow a consistent initialization pattern
3. WHEN components report status THEN they SHALL use standardized status codes and messages
4. WHEN components fail THEN they SHALL provide consistent error information
5. WHEN new components are added THEN they SHALL implement the standard integration interface
