# Production Readiness & System Audit Requirements

## Introduction

The Codebase Gardener MVP has been successfully implemented with all 19 core tasks completed. This specification focuses on preparing the system for production deployment, conducting comprehensive audits, cleaning up technical debt, and establishing operational readiness.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: System Audit and Code Review

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive audit of the implemented system, so that I can identify any technical debt, security issues, or optimization opportunities before production deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN conducting a code review THEN the system SHALL identify unused imports, dead code, and redundant implementations
2. WHEN analyzing code quality THEN the system SHALL validate adherence to established patterns and best practices
3. WHEN reviewing security THEN the system SHALL identify potential security vulnerabilities and data exposure risks
4. WHEN checking dependencies THEN the system SHALL validate all dependencies are necessary and up-to-date
5. WHEN examining error handling THEN the system SHALL ensure comprehensive error coverage and user-friendly messages

### Requirement 2: Documentation Audit and Cleanup

**User Story:** As a user and developer, I want complete, accurate, and well-organized documentation, so that I can effectively use and maintain the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing user documentation THEN it SHALL provide clear setup instructions for all supported environments
2. WHEN examining developer documentation THEN it SHALL include complete API references and architecture overviews
3. WHEN checking troubleshooting guides THEN they SHALL cover common issues with clear resolution steps
4. WHEN validating examples THEN all code examples SHALL be tested and working
5. WHEN reviewing documentation structure THEN it SHALL be logically organized and easily navigable

### Requirement 3: Production Environment Setup

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want clear production deployment procedures, so that I can reliably deploy and operate the Codebase Gardener system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up production THEN the system SHALL provide automated installation scripts
2. WHEN configuring services THEN it SHALL include Ollama setup and model management procedures
3. WHEN managing dependencies THEN it SHALL provide clear dependency installation and version management
4. WHEN monitoring system health THEN it SHALL include production monitoring and alerting setup
5. WHEN handling failures THEN it SHALL provide disaster recovery and backup procedures

### Requirement 4: Performance Optimization and Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want optimal system performance in production environments, so that the system operates efficiently under real-world conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running performance tests THEN the system SHALL meet or exceed all Mac Mini M4 optimization targets
2. WHEN handling multiple projects THEN it SHALL maintain performance with 10+ active projects
3. WHEN processing large codebases THEN it SHALL efficiently handle projects with 100k+ lines of code
4. WHEN managing memory THEN it SHALL operate within defined memory constraints under load
5. WHEN switching contexts THEN it SHALL maintain sub-second response times for project switching

### Requirement 5: Operational Readiness

**User Story:** As an operator, I want comprehensive operational tools and procedures, so that I can effectively monitor, maintain, and troubleshoot the production system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN monitoring system health THEN it SHALL provide real-time metrics and alerting
2. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN it SHALL include comprehensive logging and diagnostic tools
3. WHEN performing maintenance THEN it SHALL support zero-downtime updates and configuration changes
4. WHEN managing data THEN it SHALL provide backup and recovery procedures for user data
5. WHEN scaling usage THEN it SHALL include capacity planning and scaling guidelines

### Requirement 6: Quality Assurance and Testing

**User Story:** As a quality engineer, I want comprehensive testing coverage and quality metrics, so that I can ensure system reliability and maintainability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running test suites THEN they SHALL achieve >90% code coverage across all components
2. WHEN performing integration testing THEN all critical user workflows SHALL be validated
3. WHEN conducting load testing THEN the system SHALL handle expected production loads
4. WHEN validating security THEN all security controls SHALL be tested and verified
5. WHEN checking compatibility THEN the system SHALL work across all supported environments

### Requirement 7: User Experience Validation

**User Story:** As an end user, I want a polished, intuitive experience, so that I can effectively use the Codebase Gardener for my development workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the CLI THEN all commands SHALL provide clear help and error messages
2. WHEN using the web interface THEN it SHALL be responsive and intuitive
3. WHEN encountering errors THEN they SHALL be user-friendly with actionable guidance
4. WHEN onboarding THEN the setup process SHALL be straightforward and well-documented
5. WHEN getting support THEN comprehensive help resources SHALL be available
