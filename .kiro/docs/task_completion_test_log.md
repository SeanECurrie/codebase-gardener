# Task Completion Test Log

This document tracks the completion tests for each task, documenting what capabilities have been proven, what gaps were identified, and how well components integrate together.

**Purpose**: Provide a continuous feedback loop for task quality and system capability tracking with dynamic gap closure.

**Usage**:

- Review this log at the start of each task to understand current proven capabilities
- Use **Gap Validation Phase** to identify gaps from previous task that align with current scope
- Update this log at the end of each task with completion test details
- Use **Gap Closure Phase** to address quick wins before finalizing task
- Reference this log when asking "what can our system do now?"
- See `.kiro/docs/gap-closure-criteria.md` for detailed gap management framework

**Gap Management Enhancement**: As of Task 15, we now use a two-phase gap closure system:
- **Gap Validation Phase** (start of task): Address previous gaps that fit current scope
- **Gap Closure Phase** (end of task): Implement quick wins (<30min, low risk) before completion

## Task 14: Project Context Manager - 2025-02-04

**Test Command**:

```bash
python -c "
from src.codebase_gardener.core.project_context_manager import get_project_context_manager, ConversationMessage, ProjectContext
import tempfile
from pathlib import Path
from unittest.mock import Mock, patch

# Test basic functionality
print('Testing basic functionality...')

# Mock settings and test core operations
mock_settings = Mock()
with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as temp_dir:
    mock_settings.data_dir = Path(temp_dir)

    with patch('src.codebase_gardener.core.project_context_manager.get_settings', return_value=mock_settings):
        # Test context manager creation
        manager = get_project_context_manager()
        print(f'✓ Context manager created: {type(manager).__name__}')

        # Test message creation
        msg = ConversationMessage('user', 'Hello', manager._settings.data_dir.stat().st_mtime)
        print(f'✓ Message created: {msg.role} - {msg.content}')

        # Test context creation
        context = ProjectContext('test-project')
        context.add_message('user', 'Test message')
        print(f'✓ Context created with {len(context.conversation_history)} messages')

        # Test serialization
        data = context.to_dict()
        restored = ProjectContext.from_dict(data)
        print(f'✓ Serialization works: {restored.project_id}')

        print('All basic tests passed!')
"
```

**Test Purpose**: Validate that the project context manager can be instantiated, create conversation messages and contexts, handle serialization/deserialization, and maintain conversation history.

**Test Output**:

```
Testing basic functionality...
2025-08-05 02:17:19 [info     ] ProjectContextManager initialized contexts_dir=/var/folders/cl/qtlpq8j11zz_t9lkpp8d_2dh0000gn/T/tmp2dj5z2en/contexts max_cache_size=3
✓ Context manager created: ProjectContextManager
✓ Message created: user - Hello
✓ Context created with 1 messages
✓ Serialization works: test-project
All basic tests passed!
```

**Capabilities Proven**:

- ✅ Conversation message creation with metadata
- ✅ Project-specific context creation and management
- ✅ Message addition to conversation history
- ✅ Context serialization/deserialization for persistence
- ✅ Thread-safe initialization with proper logging

- **With DynamicModelLoader**: ⚠️ Not tested in completion test
- **Thread Safety**: ⚠️ Not validated in completion test

**Performance Metrics**:

- Context creation: Instantaneous

**Next Task Considerations**:

- Task 15 should validate context manager integration with vector stores
- Need to test project switching coordination
- Should validate persistence across application restarts
