# Task Completion Test Log

This document tracks the completion tests for each task, documenting what capabilities have been proven, what gaps were identified, and how well components integrate together.

**Purpose**: Provide a continuous feedback loop for task quality and system capability tracking with dynamic gap closure.

**Usage**:

- Review this log at the start of each task to understand current proven capabilities
- Use **Gap Validation Phase** to identify gaps from previous task that align with current scope
- Update this log at the end of each task with completion test details
- Use **Gap Closure Phase** to address quick wins before finalizing task
- Reference this log when asking "what can our system do now?"
- See `.kiro/docs/gap-closure-criteria.md` for detailed gap management framework

**Gap Management Enhancement**: As of Task 15, we now use a two-phase gap closure system:
- **Gap Validation Phase** (start of task): Address previous gaps that fit current scope
- **Gap Closure Phase** (end of task): Implement quick wins (<30min, low risk) before completion

# Test basic functionality
print('Testing basic functionality...')

# Mock settings and test core operations
mock_settings = Mock()
with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as temp_dir:
    mock_settings.data_dir = Path(temp_dir)

    with patch('src.codebase_gardener.core.project_context_manager.get_settings', return_value=mock_settings):
        # Test context manager creation
        manager = get_project_context_manager()
        print(f'✓ Context manager created: {type(manager).__name__}')

        # Test message creation
        msg = ConversationMessage('user', 'Hello', manager._settings.data_dir.stat().st_mtime)
        print(f'✓ Message created: {msg.role} - {msg.content}')

        # Test context creation
        context = ProjectContext('test-project')
        context.add_message('user', 'Test message')
        print(f'✓ Context created with {len(context.conversation_history)} messages')

        # Test serialization
