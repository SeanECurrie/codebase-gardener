# Codebase Gardener Core Principles

## Project Vision

The Codebase Gardener MVP is fundamentally about creating **specialized AI assistants** for individual codebases, not generic code analysis tools. Each codebase gets its own "brain" - a LoRA adapter trained specifically on that project's patterns, conventions, and context.

## Core Concept: Project-Specific Intelligence

### Specialized LoRA Adapters Per Codebase
- **Why**: Generic code models provide generic answers. We want AI that understands YOUR specific codebase
- **How**: Each project gets its own LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapter trained on that codebase's unique patterns
- **Result**: AI responses that understand your naming conventions, architecture decisions, and business logic

### The Project Switching Paradigm
- Users don't just "analyze code" - they **switch between specialized contexts**
- Each project maintains its own conversation history and analysis state
- Switching projects = switching to a different specialized AI assistant
- This is the core differentiator from existing tools

## Quality Over Speed Philosophy

### Deep Analysis Over Quick Responses
- **Principle**: Accurate, contextual analysis is more valuable than fast generic responses
- **Implementation**: Take time to load proper context, retrieve relevant code, and use specialized models
- **Trade-off**: Accept slower response times in exchange for significantly better accuracy and relevance

### Prove First, Scale Second Development Approach
- **Phase 1**: Build a system that works exceptionally well for 2-3 projects
- **Phase 2**: Optimize for handling dozens of projects
- **Focus**: Perfect the core experience before optimizing for scale
- **Validation**: Each feature must demonstrably improve analysis quality

## Local-First Processing Principles

### Privacy and Control
- **All processing happens locally** - no code leaves the user's machine
- **User owns their data** - models, embeddings, and analysis stay on their hardware
- **No external dependencies** for core functionality (except for downloading base models)

### Mac Mini M4 Optimization Priorities

#### Memory Efficiency
- **Dynamic model loading/unloading** to manage memory constraints
- **Efficient caching strategies** for embeddings and model states
- **Intelligent context pruning** to maintain conversation history without memory bloat

#### Resource Management
- **Batch processing** for embedding generation to maximize throughput
- **Background training** that doesn't interfere with active analysis
- **Graceful degradation** when system resources are constrained

#### Hardware-Specific Optimizations
- **Leverage Apple Silicon** neural engine capabilities where possible
- **Optimize for unified memory architecture** of M4 chips
- **Consider thermal management** for sustained processing workloads

## Development Philosophy

### User Experience First
- **The interface should feel magical** - complex AI orchestration hidden behind simple interactions
- **Project switching should be instant** from the user's perspective
- **Error states should be informative** and suggest concrete next steps

### Extensibility by Design
- **Modular architecture** that allows adding new language support
- **Plugin-ready embedding systems** for different code types
- **Configurable training pipelines** for different model sizes and capabilities

### Reliability Over Features
- **Robust error handling** at every system boundary
- **Graceful fallbacks** when specialized models fail
- **Comprehensive testing** especially for AI/ML components
- **Clear logging** for debugging complex AI workflows
- **Dynamic gap closure** to prevent quality degradation over time (see `.kiro/docs/gap-closure-criteria.md`)

## Success Metrics

### Primary Success Indicators
1. **Analysis Accuracy**: Specialized models provide demonstrably better answers than generic models
2. **User Adoption**: Developers choose to add multiple projects and use them regularly
3. **Context Retention**: Conversation history meaningfully improves subsequent interactions

### Secondary Success Indicators
1. **Performance**: Project switching feels instant (<2 seconds)
2. **Resource Usage**: System runs efficiently on Mac Mini M4 without thermal throttling
3. **Reliability**: Training and inference succeed >95% of the time

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Generic AI Tool Syndrome
- **Don't**: Build another generic code completion or analysis tool
- **Do**: Build specialized assistants that understand specific codebases

### Feature Creep
- **Don't**: Add features that don't directly improve analysis quality
- **Do**: Focus relentlessly on making project-specific analysis exceptional

### Cloud Dependency
- **Don't**: Rely on external APIs for core functionality
- **Do**: Ensure the system works completely offline after initial setup

### One-Size-Fits-All Architecture
- **Don't**: Design for the "average" use case
- **Do**: Design for the specific constraints and capabilities of Mac Mini M4

## Decision Framework

When making architectural or implementation decisions, ask:

1. **Does this improve project-specific analysis quality?**
2. **Does this maintain local-first processing principles?**
3. **Is this optimized for Mac Mini M4 constraints?**
4. **Does this support the project switching paradigm?**
5. **Will this scale to 10+ projects without degrading performance?**
6. **Does this align with our gap closure framework for continuous quality improvement?**

If the answer to any of these is "no" or "unclear," reconsider the approach.

## Quality Assurance Integration

### Dynamic Gap Closure Alignment
Our gap closure framework (`.kiro/docs/gap-closure-criteria.md`) directly supports core principles:

- **Quality Over Speed**: Gap Closure Phase ensures we ship higher quality by addressing quick wins
- **Prove First, Scale Second**: Gap Validation Phase ensures we build on proven capabilities
- **Reliability Over Features**: Systematic gap management prevents quality degradation
- **User Experience First**: Gap closure improves actual user-facing functionality

### Continuous Improvement Metrics
- **Gap Closure Rate**: >60% within 2 tasks aligns with "prove first" philosophy
- **Integration Health**: <2 integration gaps per task supports reliability goals
- **Quality Trend**: Decreasing gaps over time validates "quality over speed" approach
