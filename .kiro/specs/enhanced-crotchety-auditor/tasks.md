# Enhanced Crotchety Code Auditor - Implementation Tasks

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation tasks for enhancing the Crotchety Code Auditor with direct gpt-oss:20b integration, streaming responses, and LoRA-based codebase learning. Each task follows our established standards for research, implementation, and documentation.

## Task Standards

### Before EVERY Task (MANDATORY)

1. **Read Task Guidelines**: Read the entire `.kiro/steering/Task Guidelines.md` file completely
2. **Read Task Standards**: Read this entire "Task Standards" section completely
3. **Review Last Completed Tasks**: Review the last 3 completed tasks in `.kiro/docs/task_completion_test_log.md` in correct chronological order
4. **Sequential Thinking**: Break down the problem and evaluate approaches
5. **Context7**: Get precise documentation for libraries involved
6. **Bright Data**: Find real-world implementation examples
7. **Basic Memory**: Check previous patterns and decisions from `.kiro/memory/`

### During Each Task (MANDATORY)

1. **Use Existing Components**: Enhance rather than rebuild - check what's already in `src/codebase_gardener/`
2. **Follow Established Patterns**: Use patterns from OllamaClient, NomicEmbedder, etc.
3. **Pragmatic POC Approach**: Working code first, optimization second - NO placeholder data, NO mock tests
4. **Update Task Status**: Use `taskStatus` tool to mark tasks as in_progress → completed

### Task Completion Criteria (MANDATORY)

**A task is ONLY complete when:**

1. **Real Working Code**: Code works with actual gpt-oss:20b model (not mocked)
2. **Real Codebase**: Tested with actual codebase like `/Users/seancurrie/Desktop/MCP/notion_schema_tool/`
3. **Real User Interaction**: Can be used through actual chat window/UI
4. **User Validation**: User can see and verify it works as intended
5. **Actionable Usage**: Clear explanation of how user uses the new functionality

**NO task is complete with:**

- Mock data or placeholder responses
- Unit tests with fake data
- "Expected" or "possible" data scenarios
- Code that "should work" but isn't tested with real usage

### After Each Task (MANDATORY)

1. **Memory File Creation**: Document approach, challenges, and lessons learned in `.kiro/memory/`
2. **Real Usage Documentation**: Document exactly how user uses the new functionality
3. **Integration Testing**: Verify component works with existing system using real data
4. **Task Completion**: Update task status and document in memory file

## Implementation Tasks

- [x] **Task 1: Fix Critical Issues and Method Name Problems**

**Priority**: Critical | **Effort**: 2 hours | **Dependencies**: None

**Objective**: Fix the 300-second hang issue and method name mismatches that prevent the current system from working.

**Context**: The current system hangs for 300+ seconds on "finding source files" due to method name mismatches and lack of timeout protection.

**Before Task Research**:

- **Sequential Thinking**: Analyze the hang issue and method name problems
- **Context7**: Get timeout and error handling documentation
- **Bright Data**: Find timeout implementation patterns
- **Basic Memory**: Review `file_utilities_task17.md` for existing patterns
- **Gap Validation**: Check for file discovery issues in previous tasks

**Implementation Steps**:

1. **Foundation Reading and Context Review** (MANDATORY FIRST STEPS)

   - Read the complete text of `.kiro/steering/Task Guidelines.md` file
   - Read the complete "Task Standards" section from this tasks.md file
   - Review the last 3 completed tasks from `.kiro/docs/task_completion_test_log.md` in chronological order (Tasks 17, 18, 19)
   - Use Sequential Thinking to break down the 300-second hang problem
   - Use Context7 to get timeout and error handling documentation
   - Use Bright Data to find timeout implementation patterns
   - Check `.kiro/memory/` for existing file handling patterns

2. **Fix Method Name Issues**

   - Search codebase for `discover_source_files` references
   - Replace with `find_source_files` to match actual FileUtilities method
   - Ensure consistent usage across all components

3. **Add Timeout Protection**

   ```python
   def find_source_files_with_timeout(self, path: Path, timeout: int = 30) -> List[Path]:
       """Enhanced with timeout protection to prevent hangs"""
       @timeout_decorator(timeout)
       def _find_files():
           return self.find_source_files(path)

       try:
           return _find_files()
       except TimeoutError:
           logger.error(f"File discovery timed out after {timeout} seconds")
           raise FileDiscoveryError(f"File discovery timed out for {path}")
   ```

4. **Add Progress Feedback**

   - Implement progress callbacks during file discovery
   - Add logging for debugging long operations
   - Provide user feedback during analysis

5. **Test with Problematic Codebase**
   - Test with `/Users/seancurrie/Desktop/MCP/notion_schema_tool/`
   - Verify analysis completes in reasonable time
   - Ensure error handling works correctly

**Real Testing Requirements**:

1. **Test with Actual Codebase**: Use `/Users/seancurrie/Desktop/MCP/notion_schema_tool/` - it must complete analysis without hanging
2. **Test with Current Codebase**: Use current codebase-local-llm-advisor project - it must work
3. **User Can See Progress**: User sees actual progress messages in terminal/UI, not just "processing..."
4. **User Gets Results**: User can see the actual file list and analysis results in the chat interface

**Task Complete When User Can**:

- Enter `/Users/seancurrie/Desktop/MCP/notion_schema_tool/` in the web interface
- See it analyze without hanging for 300+ seconds
- Get actual file discovery results in reasonable time
- Chat with the system about the analyzed codebase

**After Task Requirements**:

- **Memory File**: Document exactly what was broken, how it was fixed, and what the user experience is now
- **Real Usage Documentation**: Document step-by-step how user uses the fixed system
- **Integration Test**: User can successfully analyze a real codebase through the web interface

- [ ] **Task 2: Implement DirectGPTOSSClient with HuggingFace Integration**

**Priority**: High | **Effort**: 4 hours | **Dependencies**: Task 1

**🚨 CRITICAL REMINDER: Read your core-development-principles.md steering file RIGHT NOW before starting**

**Objective**: Create direct HuggingFace Transformers integration for gpt-oss:20b with 8-bit quantization and streaming support.

**Context**: Replace Ollama middleman with direct model access for better control, streaming, and memory efficiency on Mac Mini M4.

**⚠️ BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING: What's actually broken? What's the simplest fix? Don't build complex solutions!**

**Implementation Steps**:

1. **🔍 READ CODE FIRST - DON'T TEST YET** (MANDATORY FIRST STEPS)

   **🚨 STOP: Check your core-development-principles.md - are you about to overthink this?**
   
   - Read existing `src/codebase_gardener/core/ollama_client.py` - what interface exists?
   - Read existing `src/codebase_gardener/main.py` - how is OllamaClient used?
   - **REMINDER**: You already have a working OllamaClient - enhance, don't rebuild
   - Use Sequential Thinking to analyze what's actually needed vs what seems complex
   - Use Context7 to get HuggingFace Transformers documentation
   - Use Bright Data to find simple gpt-oss:20b examples (not complex ones!)

   **🚨 REMINDER: Focus on broken functionality, not performance optimization**
   
   - Is OllamaClient not working? Or is it just not optimal?
   - What specific user workflow is broken that this fixes?
   - **CHECK**: Does the user actually need direct HuggingFace integration to work?
   - **EXISTING CODE**: You have `src/codebase_gardener/core/ollama_client.py` working

3. **🔧 SIMPLEST FIX FIRST**

   **⚠️ REMINDER: Don't build elaborate solutions - what's the obvious fix?**
   
   ```python
   # SIMPLE: Extend existing pattern, don't rebuild
   class DirectGPTOSSClient:
       def __init__(self, settings: Settings):
           # Follow EXACT same pattern as OllamaClient
           self.settings = settings
           self.model = None
           self.tokenizer = None
   ```

   **🚨 STOP: Are you building complex quantization logic? Keep it simple first!**

4. **✅ VERIFY IT WORKS**

   **REMINDER: Make it work first, optimize later**
   
   - Can you load the model at all?
   - Can you generate a simple response?
   - **DON'T**: Add streaming, quantization, optimization yet
   - **DO**: Get basic model loading and generation working

5. **🔄 THEN AND ONLY THEN: Add Features**

   **🚨 Check core-development-principles.md again - are you optimizing before it works?**
   
   - Add streaming only after basic generation works
   - Add quantization only after streaming works
   - **EXISTING PATTERNS**: Follow the same interface as OllamaClient

**🚨 CYCLICAL REMINDER: Every 30 minutes, ask yourself:**
- Am I fixing what's actually broken?
- Am I building the simplest solution that works?
- Have I read the existing code to understand what's there?

**Real Testing Requirements**:

1. **Test Basic Loading First**: Can you load gpt-oss:20b at all? Don't worry about optimization yet
2. **Test Simple Generation**: Can you get any response from the model?
3. **THEN Test Streaming**: Only after basic generation works

**Task Complete When User Can**:

- Load the DirectGPTOSSClient and get a basic response (streaming can come later)
- See that it works at all before worrying about performance
- **REMINDER**: Working functionality > Fast functionality

**🚨 FINAL REMINDER: Check your core-development-principles.md before marking complete**

   # SIMPLE: Enhance existing chat function, don't rebuild
   def enhanced_chat(message, history, codebase):
       # Use EXISTING chat logic first
       response = existing_chat_function(message, history, codebase)
       return response  # Get this working before streaming
   ```

   **🚨 STOP: Are you building complex streaming logic? Make basic chat work first!**

2. **Test Basic Workflow**: Can user get any response about their codebase?
3. **THEN Test More Components**: Only after basic integration works

**Task Complete When User Can**:

- Get some kind of analysis response about their codebase (complex orchestration is bonus)
- See that multiple components work together (advanced features are bonus)
- **REMINDER**: Working basic analysis > Complex orchestration

**🚨 FINAL REMINDER: Check your core-development-principles.md before marking complete**o LoRA-adapted chat
- See all components working together without manual coordination
- Experience the enhanced crotchety personality with codebase-specific knowledge
- Get helpful error messages and fallbacks when things go wrong

**After Task Requirements**:

- **Memory File**: Document orchestration approach, component integration, and workflow
- **Real Usage Documentation**: Document complete user workflow from start to finish
- **Integration Test**: User can use the complete enhanced system end-to-end

- [ ] **Task 8: Integration Testing and Bug Fixes**

**Priority**: High | **Effort**: 3 hours | **Dependencies**: Task 7

**Objective**: Comprehensive testing of the complete enhanced system and fixing any integration issues.

**Context**: Ensure all components work together seamlessly and the system provides the expected enhanced experience.

**Before Task Research**:

- **Sequential Thinking**: Analyze testing approaches and integration validation
- **Context7**: Get testing framework and integration testing documentation
- **Bright Data**: Find integration testing examples
- **Basic Memory**: Review testing patterns from previous tasks
- **Gap Validation**: Check for testing gaps from previous tasks

**Implementation Steps**:

1. **Foundation Reading and Context Review** (MANDATORY FIRST STEPS)

   - Read the complete text of `.kiro/steering/Task Guidelines.md` file
   - Read the complete "Task Standards" section from this tasks.md file
   - Review the last 3 completed tasks from `.kiro/docs/task_completion_test_log.md` in chronological order (Tasks 17, 18, 19)
   - Use Sequential Thinking to analyze testing approaches and integration validation
   - Use Context7 to get testing framework and integration testing documentation
   - Use Bright Data to find integration testing examples
   - Check `.kiro/memory/` for existing testing patterns

2. **Create Integration Test Suite**

   ```python
   class TestEnhancedCrotchetyAuditor:
       def test_complete_workflow(self):
           """Test complete analysis workflow"""
           auditor = CrotchetyCodeAuditor()
           result = auditor.analyze_codebase("/path/to/test/codebase")
           assert result.files
           assert result.chunks
           assert result.embeddings

       def test_streaming_responses(self):
           """Test streaming chat functionality"""
           # Test streaming token generation
           pass

       def test_lora_training(self):
           """Test LoRA adapter training"""
           # Test training on sample codebase
           pass
   ```

3. **Test with Real Codebases**

   - Test with `/Users/seancurrie/Desktop/MCP/notion_schema_tool/`
   - Test with current codebase-local-llm-advisor project
   - Verify analysis completes without hanging
   - Ensure responses are relevant and helpful

4. **Performance Testing**

   - Verify memory usage stays under 8GB on Mac Mini M4
   - Test response times for typical operations
   - Ensure streaming works smoothly
   - Validate LoRA training performance

5. **Error Handling Testing**

   - Test fallback to Ollama when direct client fails
   - Test timeout protection during file discovery
   - Test graceful handling of training failures
   - Verify error messages are helpful

6. **User Experience Testing**

   - Test complete user workflow from analysis to chat
   - Verify streaming provides good user experience
   - Test parameter controls affect responses appropriately
   - Ensure crotchety personality is consistent and engaging

7. **Fix Integration Issues**
   - Address any component compatibility issues
   - Fix performance bottlenecks
   - Resolve memory management problems
   - Improve error handling based on testing

**Real Testing Requirements**:

1. **Test Complete System**: User can use the entire enhanced system with real codebases
2. **Test All Features**: Every feature works with actual data, not mocked responses
3. **Test Performance**: System runs smoothly on Mac Mini M4 with real workloads
4. **Test User Experience**: User can accomplish their goals without confusion or errors

**Task Complete When User Can**:

- Use every feature of the enhanced system with real codebases
- Experience smooth performance during actual usage
- Get consistent, helpful responses from the crotchety engineer
- Train and use LoRA adapters successfully on their own projects

**After Task Requirements**:

- **Memory File**: Document testing approach, issues found, and solutions
- **Gap Closure**: Address any remaining gaps from previous tasks
- **Final Integration Test**: Verify system is ready for production use
