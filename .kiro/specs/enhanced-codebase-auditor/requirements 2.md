# Enhanced Codebase Auditor - Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the evolution of our current MVP CLI tool into a comprehensive "Enhanced Codebase Auditor" that combines RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with LoRA training capabilities for deep, single-project analysis. The system will maintain backwards compatibility with the existing simple CLI while adding advanced capabilities through semantic code analysis, vector storage, and fine-tuned local models.

The enhanced system transforms from a single-session analysis tool into a persistent, learning system that builds specialized knowledge for a single codebase and improves its analysis capabilities over time through continuous improvement cycles.

## Requirements

### Requirement 0: System State Validation (Pre-Implementation)

**User Story:** As a developer implementing this system, I want to validate all assumptions about current state and capabilities, so that design and implementation are based on accurate information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN beginning implementation THEN the system SHALL verify current MVP CLI functionality matches documentation
2. WHEN examining disabled components THEN the system SHALL validate that existing RAG/training infrastructure is functional
3. WHEN checking dependencies THEN the system SHALL confirm all required packages are properly installed and compatible
4. WHEN reviewing codebase structure THEN the system SHALL document actual vs assumed component relationships
5. IF any assumptions are incorrect THEN the requirements and design SHALL be updated before proceeding

### Requirement 1: Single-Project Advanced Pipeline

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to enhance my current simple CLI with advanced RAG and training capabilities for deep single-project analysis, so that I can get increasingly sophisticated insights about my codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL function as the current MVP CLI by default
2. WHEN advanced features are requested THEN the system SHALL activate RAG and training capabilities for the current project
3. WHEN advanced mode is active THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing CLI functionality while adding enhanced capabilities
4. IF advanced mode dependencies are missing THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to simple mode with clear messaging
5. WHEN switching between simple and advanced analysis THEN the system SHALL preserve user context and project state

### Requirement 2: Semantic Code Analysis and Chunking

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to understand my code's structure and semantics, so that it can provide more accurate and contextually relevant analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing a codebase THEN the system SHALL parse code using Tree-sitter for structural analysis
2. WHEN chunking code THEN the system SHALL create semantic boundaries at function, class, and module levels
3. WHEN analyzing code chunks THEN the system SHALL extract metadata including complexity, dependencies, and relationships
4. WHEN storing chunks THEN the system SHALL generate embeddings that capture semantic meaning
5. IF parsing fails for a file THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with remaining files

### Requirement 3: Vector Store and RAG Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to retrieve relevant code context for my queries, so that AI responses are grounded in actual codebase content rather than generic programming knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a project is processed THEN the system SHALL store code embeddings in a project-specific vector database
2. WHEN a user asks a question THEN the system SHALL retrieve the most relevant code chunks using semantic similarity within 200ms for queries under 1000 tokens
3. WHEN generating responses THEN the system SHALL include retrieved context in the prompt to the language model
4. WHEN updating a project THEN the system SHALL incrementally update embeddings for changed files only
5. WHEN measuring retrieval quality THEN the system SHALL achieve >80% relevance for top-3 results on project-specific queries
6. IF vector search fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to base model responses with appropriate user notification

### Requirement 4: LoRA Training Pipeline

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to learn my codebase's specific patterns and conventions, so that it provides increasingly accurate and project-specific analysis over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sufficient code data is available (minimum 50 functions/classes) THEN the system SHALL offer to train a project-specific LoRA adapter
2. WHEN training is initiated THEN the system SHALL complete LoRA training within 30 minutes for codebases under 10MB using <2GB memory
3. WHEN training is in progress THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress updates and estimated completion time
4. WHEN training completes THEN the system SHALL automatically switch to using the trained adapter for that project
5. WHEN measuring training success THEN the system SHALL achieve measurable improvement over base model on project-specific queries
6. WHEN training fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fall back to base model + RAG
7. IF system resources are insufficient THEN the system SHALL defer training and notify the user of requirements

### Requirement 5: Continuous Improvement Workflow

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to improve its analysis quality over time as I use it more, so that it becomes increasingly valuable for my specific project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new code is added to the project THEN the system SHALL automatically update embeddings and suggest retraining
2. WHEN user provides explicit feedback (thumbs up/down, rating 1-5) THEN the system SHALL log this for training data improvement
3. WHEN the system detects response quality issues (low confidence, user corrections) THEN the system SHALL automatically flag for improvement
4. WHEN the project reaches training thresholds (20% new code, 10+ negative feedback items) THEN the system SHALL automatically trigger background retraining
5. WHEN retraining completes THEN the system SHALL A/B test new vs old model and switch if improvement is detected
6. IF continuous improvement fails THEN the system SHALL maintain current capabilities without degradation

### Requirement 6: Backwards Compatibility and Migration

**User Story:** As a current user of the MVP CLI, I want all my existing workflows to continue working unchanged, so that I can adopt the enhanced features gradually without disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the existing CLI commands THEN the system SHALL produce identical results to the current MVP
2. WHEN the enhanced system is installed THEN existing scripts and integrations SHALL continue to function
3. WHEN migrating to advanced mode THEN the system SHALL preserve all existing analysis and export capabilities
4. WHEN advanced features are disabled THEN the system SHALL function exactly as the current MVP
5. IF migration fails THEN the system SHALL provide rollback capabilities to the previous state

### Requirement 7: Resource Management and Performance

**User Story:** As a developer running on local hardware (Mac Mini M4), I want the system to efficiently manage memory and compute resources, so that it runs smoothly without impacting other applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN advanced features are active THEN the system SHALL dynamically manage memory usage within 6GB limits
2. WHEN switching between simple and advanced modes THEN the system SHALL efficiently load/unload models and vector stores
3. WHEN training models THEN the system SHALL monitor system resources and pause if constraints are exceeded
4. WHEN system memory is low THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade to simpler analysis modes
5. IF resource limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL provide clear guidance on optimization options

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to handle errors gracefully and provide clear feedback, so that I can understand and resolve issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any component fails THEN the system SHALL continue operating with reduced functionality rather than crashing
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide specific, actionable error messages with suggested solutions
3. WHEN dependencies are missing THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate what needs to be installed
4. WHEN data corruption is detected THEN the system SHALL attempt automatic recovery and provide backup options
5. IF critical failures occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging and provide safe restart options

### Requirement 9: Development and Testing Infrastructure

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining this system, I want comprehensive testing and development tools, so that I can confidently make changes and ensure system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code changes are made THEN automated tests SHALL verify both simple and advanced mode functionality
2. WHEN new features are added THEN integration tests SHALL verify end-to-end workflows
3. WHEN performance changes are made THEN benchmarks SHALL verify resource usage stays within limits
4. WHEN releases are prepared THEN CI/CD SHALL verify compatibility across different system configurations
5. IF tests fail THEN the system SHALL provide detailed failure information and prevent deployment of broken code

### Requirement 10: Multi-Environment Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer deploying this system, I want it to work reliably across different environments, so that it can be used in various development setups.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deployed on Mac Mini M4 (primary target) THEN the system SHALL run all advanced features within resource constraints
2. WHEN deployed on Linux x86_64 systems THEN the system SHALL maintain full functionality with appropriate performance scaling
