# Enhanced Codebase Auditor - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan transforms the current MVP CLI tool into a comprehensive RAG + LoRA training system through four carefully orchestrated phases. Each task is designed to be completed in ≤45 minutes and maintains full backwards compatibility throughout the process.

The plan reactivates existing disabled components rather than building from scratch, leveraging the comprehensive infrastructure already developed in `src/codebase_gardener_DISABLED/`.

## Task Execution Framework Integration

**MANDATORY**: Each task MUST follow the complete Task Execution Framework from `.kiro/steering/task-execution-framework.md`:

### Pre-Task Phase (MANDATORY for each task)
1. **Previous Task Validation** - Read memory files, verify completion criteria, check gaps
2. **Foundation Reading** - Core principles, task guidelines, previous memory, gap closure framework
3. **MCP Tools Research** - Sequential Thinking → Context7 → Bright Data → Basic Memory (in order)

### During Task Phase (MANDATORY for each task)
4. **Implementation Approach** - Problem statement, alternatives considered, architectural decisions
5. **Implementation Tracking** - Challenges, code patterns, configuration decisions
6. **Task Status Management** - Mark in_progress/completed with TodoWrite tool

### Post-Task Phase (MANDATORY for each task)
7. **Gap Closure Phase** - Quick wins (<30min), next task gaps, deferred gaps
8. **Integration and Testing** - Connection points, interfaces, data flow, test cases
9. **Memory File Creation** - Comprehensive handoff document for next task
10. **Git and GitHub Integration** - Feature branch, conventional commits, PR creation
11. **Documentation Updates** - Task completion log, API docs, steering updates

### Task Completion Criteria
- ✅ Functional: Real working code, real data, real user interaction, user validation, actionable usage
- ✅ Process: Previous task validated, MCP tools used, gap closure applied, memory file created, git integration, documentation updated, next task prepared
- ✅ Quality: Integration tested, error handling, performance acceptable, code quality

## Task Execution Guidelines

### Prerequisites for Each Phase

- **Phase 1**: Current MVP CLI must be fully functional
- **Phase 2**: Phase 1 components must be reactivated and tested
- **Phase 3**: Phase 2 RAG system must be operational
- **Phase 4**: Phase 3 training pipeline must be functional

### Success Criteria for Task Completion

1. **Functional Requirements**: All specified functionality works as designed
2. **Backwards Compatibility**: Existing CLI functionality remains unchanged
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks implemented for all failure scenarios
4. **Performance**: Resource usage stays within Mac Mini M4 constraints
5. **Testing**: Comprehensive tests pass for implemented functionality
6. **Documentation**: Implementation is documented with clear usage examples

### Risk Mitigation Strategies

- **Incremental Development**: Each task builds on proven functionality
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Every task includes validation and testing
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Advanced features fail gracefully to simple mode
- **Resource Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring prevents resource exhaustion
- **Rollback Capabilities**: Each phase can be rolled back if issues arise

### Integration Points Between Tasks

- **Task Dependencies**: Each task clearly specifies which previous tasks must be complete
- **Interface Contracts**: Clear interfaces defined between components
- **Data Flow Validation**: Data flow between components is tested and validated
- **Error Propagation**: Error handling is consistent across component boundaries
- **Resource Sharing**: Shared resources are managed consistently across tasks

## Cyclical Execution Guarantees

### For Claude Code as Task Executor

**I commit to the following cyclical execution pattern for each task:**

1. **ALWAYS start with Previous Task Validation** - No exceptions, even for Task 1
2. **ALWAYS use all 4 MCP tools in order** - Sequential Thinking → Context7 → Bright Data → Basic Memory
3. **ALWAYS follow "Make it work first"** - Fix broken functionality before optimizing
4. **ALWAYS create comprehensive memory files** - Full handoff documentation for continuity
5. **ALWAYS use TodoWrite tool** - Mark tasks in_progress → completed with validation
6. **ALWAYS apply Gap Closure methodology** - Address quick wins, document deferred items
7. **ALWAYS test with real data/interaction** - No theoretical implementations
8. **ALWAYS maintain backwards compatibility** - Existing CLI must keep working

### Failure Recovery Protocol

**If any task completion criteria are not met:**
1. **Stop and analyze** - Don't proceed to next task
2. **Read core-development-principles.md** - Refocus on "make it work first"
3. **Apply gap closure** - Address missing criteria systematically
4. **Update memory file** - Document what was missing and why
5. **Retry with corrected approach** - Don't skip validation steps

### Continuity Mechanism

**Between tasks:**
- Previous task memory file is the authoritative source of truth
- Gap closure documents become input for next task planning
- TodoWrite tool maintains overall project state
- Git commits provide rollback points if needed

This implementation plan provides a systematic approach to evolving the MVP CLI into a sophisticated RAG + training system while maintaining reliability, performance, and user experience throughout the development process.
