# Enhanced Codebase Auditor - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan transforms the current MVP CLI tool into a comprehensive RAG + LoRA training system through four carefully orchestrated phases. Each task is designed to be completed in ≤45 minutes and maintains full backwards compatibility throughout the process.

The plan reactivates existing disabled components rather than building from scratch, leveraging the comprehensive infrastructure already developed in `src/codebase_gardener_DISABLED/`.

## Task Execution Framework
