# Codebase Intelligence Auditor - Requirements Document

## Introduction

Create a comprehensive codebase analysis tool that helps developers better direct AI agents by providing thorough intelligence about code architecture, tech debt, quality issues, and documentation gaps. The goal is to have an AI assistant that truly reads and understands everything in a codebase, providing actionable intelligence without usage limits or context window constraints.

## Core Vision

**Primary Goal:** Build an AI-powered codebase auditor that provides comprehensive intelligence to help developers better prompt and direct AI coding agents.

**Key Principle:** Thoroughness over speed - we want complete, accurate analysis that covers everything, not fast superficial scanning.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Comprehensive Codebase Analysis

**User Story:** As a developer, I want an AI tool that reads through my entire codebase without context limits, so that I can get complete intelligence about my project's structure and issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I point the tool at a codebase directory THEN it SHALL analyze all source files without context window limitations
2. WHEN analyzing large codebases THEN it SHALL process files systematically without missing any components
3. WHEN encountering different file types THEN it SHALL understand and analyze Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Markdown, JSON, YAML, and configuration files
4. WHEN processing is complete THEN it SHALL have read and understood the entire codebase structure

### Requirement 2: Architecture and Component Relationship Mapping

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand how my codebase components relate to each other, so that I can better explain the architecture to AI agents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN it SHALL identify all major components and modules
2. WHEN mapping relationships THEN it SHALL understand import/export dependencies between files
3. WHEN analyzing architecture THEN it SHALL identify design patterns and architectural decisions
4. WHEN documenting structure THEN it SHALL create a clear map of how components interact
5. WHEN finding circular dependencies THEN it SHALL flag them as potential issues

### Requirement 3: Tech Debt and Code Quality Detection

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify technical debt and code quality issues, so that I can prioritize improvements and inform AI agents about problem areas.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing code quality THEN it SHALL identify inconsistent naming conventions
2. WHEN reviewing code patterns THEN it SHALL find duplicated logic and suggest consolidation opportunities
3. WHEN examining error handling THEN it SHALL identify missing or inconsistent error handling patterns
4. WHEN analyzing complexity THEN it SHALL flag overly complex functions or classes
5. WHEN reviewing dependencies THEN it SHALL identify unused imports and dependencies
6. WHEN checking consistency THEN it SHALL find inconsistent code styles and patterns

### Requirement 4: Documentation Gap Analysis

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand where my documentation is missing or outdated, so that I can improve it and help AI agents understand the codebase better.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing documentation THEN it SHALL identify functions and classes without docstrings
2. WHEN reviewing README files THEN it SHALL check if they accurately reflect the current codebase
3. WHEN examining comments THEN it SHALL identify outdated or misleading comments
4. WHEN checking API documentation THEN it SHALL verify if public interfaces are properly documented
5. WHEN analyzing examples THEN it SHALL check if code examples in documentation still work

### Requirement 5: Intelligent Reporting and Export

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to receive analysis results in formats I can easily use to brief AI agents, so that I can provide comprehensive context for coding tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis is complete THEN it SHALL provide results through a chat interface
2. WHEN requesting reports THEN it SHALL generate structured markdown reports for export
3. WHEN presenting findings THEN it SHALL prioritize issues by severity and impact
4. WHEN creating summaries THEN it SHALL provide executive summaries suitable for AI agent briefings
5. WHEN exporting results THEN it SHALL create markdown files that can be easily shared with AI agents

### Requirement 6: Single Codebase Focus (MVP)

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to analyze one codebase at a time thoroughly, so that I can get deep insights without complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting analysis THEN it SHALL focus on a single codebase directory
2. WHEN switching codebases THEN it SHALL require manual cleanup/reset of previous analysis
3. WHEN storing analysis THEN it SHALL use temporary storage that can be easily cleared
4. WHEN managing resources THEN it SHALL optimize for single-codebase deep analysis over multi-project switching

## Technical Requirements

### Model Integration

**Use Existing gpt-oss-20b via Ollama:**
- Leverage existing working Ollama setup with gpt-oss-20b model
- No additional model downloads or disk space usage
- Utilize proven performance (70+ tokens/sec on Mac M4)

### Performance Expectations

**Thoroughness Over Speed:**
- Complete analysis is more valuable than fast analysis
- Acceptable to take minutes for comprehensive codebase review
- Focus on accuracy and completeness over response time

### Output Formats

**Dual Interface:**
- Interactive chat interface for questions and exploration
- Markdown report export for sharing with AI agents
- Clear, actionable findings with specific file references

### Resource Management

**Disk Space Conscious:**
- No persistent storage of analysis results initially
- Generate reports on-demand
- Use existing model infrastructure without additional downloads

## Success Criteria

### Primary Success Indicators

1. **Complete Coverage:** Tool analyzes entire codebase without missing components
2. **Actionable Intelligence:** Findings help developers better direct AI agents
3. **Accurate Analysis:** Issues identified are real and relevant (validated against other tools)
4. **Usable Output:** Reports are clear and can be effectively shared with AI agents

### Validation Approach

**Multi-Tool Comparison:**
- Compare results with Codex, Claude with MCP tools, Cursor, Windsurf
- Validate findings against ChatGPT-5 deep research
- Ensure analysis accuracy through cross-validation

## Non-Requirements (Out of Scope for MVP)

- Multi-codebase project switching
- Persistent storage of analysis results
- Real-time code change monitoring
- Integration with IDEs or external tools
- Performance optimization beyond basic functionality
- Advanced visualization or graphical interfaces

## Risk Mitigation

### Analysis Accuracy
- Cross-validate findings with multiple AI tools
- Focus on clear, specific issues rather than vague suggestions
- Provide file and line references for all findings

### Resource Management
- Monitor disk space usage during analysis
- Implement cleanup procedures for temporary files
- Avoid storing large intermediate results

### Scope Management
- Resist feature creep beyond core analysis functionality
- Focus on intelligence generation over user interface polish
- Prioritize working functionality over advanced features
