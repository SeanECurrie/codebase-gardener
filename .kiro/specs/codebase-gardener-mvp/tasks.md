# Implementation Plan

## Context Routing Guide

**Before starting any task, read these specific documents based on task type:**

- **WHEN** implementing AI/ML components (Tasks 5, 7-15) → READ `.kiro/steering/ai-ml-architecture-context.md`
- **WHEN** making architecture decisions → READ `.kiro/steering/codebase-gardener-principles.md`
- **WHEN** unsure about patterns or using MCP tools → READ `.kiro/steering/development-best-practices.md`
- **WHEN** starting any task → READ previous 2-3 memory files in `.kiro/memory/`
- **WHEN** creating memory files → USE template in `.kiro/docs/templates/memory-file-template.md`
