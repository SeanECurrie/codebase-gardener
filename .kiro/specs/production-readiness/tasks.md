# Production Readiness Implementation Plan

## Context Routing Guide

**Before starting any task, read these specific documents:**

- **WHEN** conducting audits → READ `.kiro/docs/task_completion_test_log.md` for current system state
- **WHEN** making cleanup decisions → READ `.kiro/steering/Task Guidelines.md` for pragmatic approach
- **WHEN** preparing production deployment → READ `.kiro/steering/codebase-gardener-principles.md` for system principles
