# Task 2: Single-File Codebase Auditor - Completion Notes

## Approach Decision
- Followed Pragmatic POC: keep it single-file, hardcoded prompt, direct Ollama usage.
- Used existing `SimpleFileUtilities` for file discovery with progress callbacks.
- Avoided heavy dependencies; enabled env overrides `OLLAMA_HOST` and `OLLAMA_MODEL`.
- Kept storage simple: in-memory dict with full analysis text and file list.

## Implementation Notes
- Added simple preflight model check to return a friendly message if the selected model is unavailable.
- Implemented minimal size caps (max files, per-file bytes, total bytes) to avoid context overflows without complex chunk orchestration.
- Preserved clear file headers in the prompt for traceability.
- CLI supports `analyze`, `chat`, and `export` as specified.

## Integration Points
- `codebase_auditor.py` imports `SimpleFileUtilities` from `simple_file_utils.py`.
- Startup script `start_auditor.sh` exports `OLLAMA_MODEL` and launches the single-file auditor.
- README updated with a minimal quickstart flow; `requirements-min.txt` lists only `ollama`.

## Testing Strategy
- Added `tests/test_single_file_auditor.py` using `unittest.mock.patch` to mock `ollama.Client`.
- Validates that analyze/chat/export work without real model calls.

## Lessons Learned
- The simplest working caps avoid failures on larger codebases without premature architecture.
- Env-based model selection plus a preflight check reduces confusion during setup.

## Next Task Considerations
- If needed, add multi-request chunking (phase analysis + final synthesis) and progress per chunk.
- Consider a small filter for obviously binary or excessively large files even if they match extensions.
