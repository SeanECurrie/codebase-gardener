# Task 12: LoRA Training Pipeline - 2025-02-04

## Task Overview
- **Task Number**: 12
- **Component**: LoRA Training Pipeline
- **Date Started**: 2025-02-04
- **Date Completed**: 2025-02-04
- **Developer**: Kiro AI Assistant
- **Branch**: feat/lora-training-pipeline

## Approach Decision

### Problem Statement
Implement a comprehensive LoRA training pipeline that orchestrates the training of project-specific adapters. The pipeline must coordinate between existing components (PeftManager, ProjectRegistry, preprocessing) to provide a seamless training experience with progress tracking, error handling, and Mac Mini M4 optimization.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Direct PeftManager Usage**:
   - Pros: Simple implementation, direct access to training functionality
   - Cons: No orchestration, no progress tracking, no integration with other components
   - Decision: Rejected - Insufficient for production-grade system requirements

2. **Simple Training Wrapper**:
   - Pros: Basic orchestration, some progress tracking
   - Cons: Limited integration, no resource management, basic error handling
   - Decision: Rejected - Doesn't meet comprehensive pipeline requirements

3. **Comprehensive Training Pipeline with Orchestration**:
   - Pros: Full orchestration, progress tracking, resource management, error handling
   - Cons: Higher implementation complexity, more integration points
   - Decision: Chosen - Best fit for project requirements and user experience

### Chosen Approach
Implementing a comprehensive TrainingPipeline class that orchestrates the entire training process:
- Coordinates between PeftManager, ProjectRegistry, and preprocessing components
- Provides real-time progress tracking with callbacks for UI integration
- Implements background training with thread management
- Includes comprehensive error handling and resource monitoring
- Optimized for Mac Mini M4 memory constraints
- Supports training cancellation and status management

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **Orchestrator Pattern**: TrainingPipeline coordinates existing components rather than reimplementing functionality
- **Background Processing**: Training runs in separate threads to avoid blocking UI
- **Progress Tracking**: Comprehensive progress system with phases and callbacks
- **Resource Management**: Memory monitoring and constraint checking
- **Error Handling**: Integration with established error handling framework
- **Configuration-Driven**: Configurable parameters for different deployment scenarios

### Code Patterns Established
```python
# Pattern 1: Orchestrator with background processing
class TrainingPipeline:
    def start_training(self, project_name: str, progress_callback: Optional[Callable] = None) -> str:
        # Create progress tracker
        progress_tracker = TrainingProgressTracker(project_name, self.config)
        if progress_callback:
            progress_tracker.add_progress_callback(progress_callback)
        
        # Start training in background thread
        training_thread = threading.Thread(
            target=self._run_training,
            args=(project_name, progress_tracker),
            daemon=True
        )
        training_thread.start()
        return training_id
```

```python
# Pattern 2: Progress tracking with phase management
class TrainingProgressTracker:
    def update_progress(self, phase: TrainingPhase, progress_percent: float, message: str):
        with self._lock:
            self._current_progress = TrainingProgress(phase, progress_percent, message)
            
            # Update registry status
            self.registry.update_training_status(self.project_name, status)
            
            # Notify callbacks
            for callback in self._callbacks:
                callback(self._current_progress)
```

```python
# Pattern 3: Training data preparation with quality filtering
class TrainingDataPreparator:
    def prepare_training_data(self, project_name: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        chunks = self._load_code_chunks(project_name)
        quality_chunks = self._filter_quality_chunks(chunks)
        
        if len(quality_chunks) < self.config.min_training_chunks:
            raise TrainingError("Insufficient training data")
        
        return self._convert_to_training_format(quality_chunks)
```

### Configuration Decisions
- **Min Training Chunks**: 50 - Ensure sufficient data for meaningful training
- **Max Training Chunks**: 5000 - Prevent memory issues on Mac Mini M4
- **Memory Limit**: 4GB - Leave headroom for system operations
- **Training Timeout**: 30 minutes - Reasonable time limit for typical codebases
- **Progress Update Interval**: 5 seconds - Balance between responsiveness and overhead

### Dependencies Added
- **threading**: Built-in - Background processing and thread management
- **psutil**: Optional - Memory monitoring (graceful fallback if not available)

## Integration Points

### How This Component Connects to Others
- **PeftManager (Task 10)**: Delegates actual LoRA training operations
- **ProjectRegistry (Task 11)**: Updates training status and metadata throughout process
- **Preprocessing (Task 6)**: Consumes CodeChunk objects for training data preparation
- **Configuration (Task 2)**: Uses settings for training parameters and resource limits
- **Error Handling (Task 4)**: Uses established exception hierarchy and retry patterns

### Dependencies and Interfaces
```python
# Input interfaces
from codebase_gardener.core.project_registry import ProjectRegistry, TrainingStatus
from codebase_gardener.models.peft_manager import PeftManager
from codebase_gardener.data.preprocessor import CodeChunk, CodePreprocessor

# Output interfaces
class TrainingPipeline:
    def start_training(self, project_name: str, progress_callback: Optional[Callable] = None) -> str
    def get_training_progress(self, project_name: str) -> Optional[TrainingProgress]
    def is_training_active(self, project_name: str) -> bool
    def cancel_training(self, project_name: str) -> bool
```

### Data Flow Considerations
1. **Input Data**: Project name, optional progress callback
2. **Processing**: Data preparation → LoRA training → Status updates → Completion
3. **Output Data**: Training ID, progress updates, completion notifications

### Error Handling Integration
- **TrainingError**: Custom exception for training pipeline failures
- **Retry Logic**: Uses established retry patterns for transient failures
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues with partial results when possible
- **Resource Monitoring**: Checks memory availability before starting training

@patch('codebase_gardener.core.training_pipeline.ProjectRegistry')
@patch('codebase_gardener.core.training_pipeline.PeftManager')
@patch('codebase_gardener.core.training_pipeline.TrainingDataPreparator')
def test_full_training_workflow(self, mock_preparator_class, mock_peft_manager_class, mock_registry_class):
    # Mock all external dependencies to isolate pipeline logic
    pass

# Progress callback testing
def test_progress_callbacks(self):
    progress_updates = []
    def progress_callback(progress):
        progress_updates.append(progress)
    
    # Verify callbacks are called with correct progress data
```

## Lessons Learned
