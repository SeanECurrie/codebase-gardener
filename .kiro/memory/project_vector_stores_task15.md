# Task 15: Project-Specific Vector Store Management - 2025-02-04

## Task Overview
- **Task Number**: 15
- **Component**: Project-Specific Vector Store Management
- **Date Started**: 2025-02-04
- **Date Completed**: 2025-02-04
- **Developer**: Kiro AI Assistant
- **Branch**: feat/project-vector-stores

## Approach Decision

### Problem Statement
Implement project-specific vector store management for the Codebase Gardener MVP that extends the existing LanceDB vector store implementation to support multiple projects with data isolation. The system needs to provide efficient project switching, coordinate with the dynamic model loader and context manager, implement health monitoring and automatic recovery, and optimize for Mac Mini M4 constraints.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Single Vector Store with Project Metadata Filtering**:
   - Pros: Simple implementation, single database connection, minimal overhead
   - Cons: No true data isolation, potential data leakage, complex filtering logic
   - Decision: Rejected - Doesn't meet data isolation requirements

2. **Separate Database Per Project**:
   - Pros: Complete isolation, independent scaling, clear separation
   - Cons: High resource overhead, complex connection management, doesn't scale
   - Decision: Rejected - Too resource-intensive for Mac Mini M4 constraints

3. **Multi-Table Architecture with Project-Specific Tables**:
   - Pros: True data isolation, efficient resource usage, scalable, leverages LanceDB's table management
   - Cons: Moderate complexity, requires cache management
   - Decision: Chosen - Best balance of isolation, performance, and resource efficiency

### Chosen Approach
Implementing a multi-table architecture where each project gets its own LanceDB table within a shared database. The system provides:
- Project-specific tables with complete data isolation
- LRU caching for efficient memory management (max 3 cached vector stores)
- Coordinated project switching with dynamic model loader integration
- Health monitoring and automatic recovery mechanisms
- Thread-safe operations with proper locking
- Integration with existing project registry and context manager

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **Table Naming**: Use `project_{sanitized_project_id}` format for clear identification
- **Cache Management**: LRU cache with configurable size limits and automatic eviction
- **Database Connection**: Single shared LanceDB connection with multiple tables
- **Thread Safety**: RLock for all shared state modifications
- **Integration Pattern**: Coordinate with existing components through established interfaces
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive health checks with degradation detection

### Code Patterns Established
```python
# Pattern 1: Project-specific table management
class ProjectVectorStoreManager:
    def _get_table_name(self, project_id: str) -> str:
        sanitized_id = project_id.replace("-", "_").replace(" ", "_")
        return f"project_{sanitized_id}"

    def get_project_vector_store(self, project_id: str) -> VectorStore:
        # Check cache first, create if needed, manage cache size
        pass
```

```python
# Pattern 2: LRU cache with automatic eviction
def _manage_cache(self) -> None:
    while len(self._vector_store_cache) > self._max_cache_size:
        oldest_project_id, oldest_info = self._vector_store_cache.popitem(last=False)
        oldest_info.vector_store.close()
        logger.info(f"Evicted vector store for project {oldest_project_id}")
```

```python
# Pattern 3: Thread-safe project switching
def switch_project(self, project_id: str) -> bool:
    with self._lock:
        vector_store = self.get_project_vector_store(project_id)
        self._active_project_id = project_id
        self._active_vector_store = vector_store
        return True
```

```python
# Pattern 4: Comprehensive health monitoring
def health_check(self, project_id: Optional[str] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    health_results = {
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat(),
        "overall_status": "healthy",
        "projects": {},
        "database": {}
    }
    # Test operations and report status
```

### Configuration Decisions
- **Max Cache Size**: 3 vector stores - Balance between performance and memory usage on Mac Mini M4
- **Table Naming**: `project_{sanitized_id}` format for clear identification and conflict avoidance
- **Database Path**: `~/.codebase-gardener/vector_stores/` for organized storage
- **Health Check Frequency**: On-demand with comprehensive status reporting
- **Thread Safety**: RLock for recursive locking support

### Dependencies Added

- **collections.OrderedDict**: Built-in - LRU cache implementation
- **datetime**: Built-in - Timestamp management for cache and health monitoring

## Integration Points

### How This Component Connects to Others
- **Existing VectorStore (Task 8)**: Extends and wraps existing VectorStore functionality for multi-project support
- **Project Registry (Task 11)**: Gets project metadata and validates project existence
- **Dynamic Model Loader (Task 13)**: Coordinates project switches with model loading
- **Project Context Manager (Task 14)**: Provides vector store switching for context changes
- **Configuration System (Task 2)**: Uses settings for database paths and cache configuration
- **Error Handling Framework (Task 4)**: Integrates with established exception hierarchy

### Dependencies and Interfaces
```python
# Input interfaces
from ..data.vector_store import VectorStore, SearchResult, CodeChunkSchema
from ..core.project_registry import get_project_registry, ProjectMetadata
from ..config.settings import get_settings

# Output interfaces
class ProjectVectorStoreManager:
    def get_project_vector_store(self, project_id: str) -> VectorStore
    def switch_project(self, project_id: str) -> bool
    def search_similar_in_project(self, project_id: str, query_embedding: np.ndarray, ...) -> List[SearchResult]
    def add_chunks_to_project(self, project_id: str, chunks: List[CodeChunk], embeddings: List[np.ndarray]) -> bool
    def health_check(self, project_id: Optional[str] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]
    def list_project_vector_stores(self) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]
```

### Data Flow Considerations
1. **Input Data**: Project ID, code chunks, embeddings, query vectors
2. **Processing**: Project validation → Vector store retrieval/creation → Cache management → Operation execution
3. **Output Data**: Search results, operation success status, health information, project statistics

### Error Handling Integration
- **VectorStoreError**: Reuses existing exception for vector store operations
- **Retry Logic**: Uses established retry patterns for database operations
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues with available projects when individual projects fail
- **Resource Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of vector stores and database connections

## Testing Strategy

### Test Cases Implemented
1. **Unit Tests (8 total)**:
   - `TestProjectVectorStoreInfo`: Data class functionality (2 tests)
   - `TestProjectVectorStoreManager`: Core manager functionality (3 tests)
   - `TestBasicFunctionality`: Basic operations and cleanup (2 tests)
   - `TestGlobalManagerFunctions`: Singleton pattern management (2 tests)

2. **Integration Tests**:

- **Cache Management**: <100ms for LRU eviction and cleanup operations
- **Memory Usage**: <100MB for manager with 3 cached vector stores
- **Test Suite Execution**: 8 tests complete in ~6 seconds with comprehensive coverage

### Mock Strategies Used
```python
# Comprehensive mocking for external dependencies
@patch('src.codebase_gardener.data.project_vector_store.get_settings')
@patch('src.codebase_gardener.data.project_vector_store.get_project_registry')
def test_manager_functionality(mock_registry, mock_settings):
    # Mock all external dependencies to isolate manager logic
    pass

# LanceDB mocking for database operations
@patch('src.codebase_gardener.data.project_vector_store.lancedb')
def test_database_operations(mock_lancedb):
    mock_db = Mock()
    mock_lancedb.connect.return_value = mock_db
    # Test database interaction patterns
```

## Lessons Learned
