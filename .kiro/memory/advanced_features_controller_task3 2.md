   - **Constraint Checking:** Automatic resource management with cleanup

### Architectural Decisions ✅

1. **Layer 2 Enhancement Controller Architecture**
   - **Layer 1:** Core CLI (`codebase_auditor.py`) - unchanged and fully functional
   - **Layer 2:** Advanced Features Controller - coordinates advanced components
   - **Layer 3:** Advanced Components - loaded on demand through Layer 2

2. **Feature Availability System**
   ```python
   feature_components = {
       "rag_retrieval": ["vector_store", "project_vector_store_manager"],
       "semantic_search": ["vector_store"],
       "training_pipeline": ["peft_manager", "training_pipeline", "dynamic_model_loader"],
       "project_management": ["project_registry", "project_context_manager"],
       "vector_storage": ["vector_store"],
       "embedding_generation": ["vector_store", "dynamic_model_loader"]
   }
   ```

3. **Enhancement Level Determination**
   - **Simple:** ≤5 files or insufficient features
   - **Standard:** 6-100 files with ≥3 features available
   - **Advanced:** >100 files with ≥5 features available

## Post-Task Phase Results

### Integration and Testing ✅

1. **MVP CLI Validation**
   ```bash
   # Smoke test - PASSED
   PYTHONPATH=. python scripts/smoke_cli.py

   # Focused tests - PASSED (8/8)
   pytest -q tests/test_single_file_auditor.py tests/test_project_structure.py
   ```

2. **Advanced Features Integration Testing**
   ```python
   # Feature detection working correctly
   check_advanced_features() → False (as expected, data components not yet implemented)
   get_enhancement_level(Path('.')) → "simple" (correct for current state)
   ```

3. **CLI Enhancement Integration**
   - Enhancement hooks added to `analyze_codebase()` method
   - Graceful fallback when advanced features unavailable
   - No impact on existing functionality or performance

### Component Registry Integration ✅

**Updated Registration:**
- `project_registry` → `ProjectRegistry` class
- `project_context_manager` → `ProjectContextManager` class
- `dynamic_model_loader` → `DynamicModelLoader` class
- All components registered with proper dependencies and fallback patterns

**Component Availability Detection:**
- Thread-safe component loading with dependency checking
- Graceful fallback to ComponentMock when components unavailable
- Feature caching with 5-minute TTL for performance optimization

### Gap Closure Analysis ✅

**Task 2 Gaps Addressed:**
- ✅ Core component moves - All major components (project_registry, project_context_manager, dynamic_model_loader) moved and integrated
- ✅ CLI integration hooks - Enhancement detection added to CodebaseAuditor class

## Key Technical Implementation Details

### Advanced Features Controller Architecture

```python
class AdvancedFeaturesController:
    """Layer 2 Enhancement Controller that coordinates advanced features."""

    def check_feature_availability(self, feature_name: str) -> bool:
        # Dynamic availability detection with caching

    def get_enhancement_level(self, directory_path: Path) -> str:
        # Analyze codebase complexity and available features

    def enhance_analysis(self, analysis_context: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Apply available enhancements to analysis results

    def get_resource_status(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # Monitor Mac Mini M4 constraints
```

### Component Coordination Patterns

```python
def _check_component_availability(self, feature_name: str) -> bool:
    """Check if components for a feature are available."""
    required_components = feature_components.get(feature_name, [])

    for component_name in required_components:
        component = self.registry.get_component(component_name)
        # Check if it's a mock (fallback)
        if hasattr(component, '_is_mock') and component._is_mock:
            return False

    return True
```

### CLI Integration Pattern

```python
def _try_enhance_analysis(self, dir_path: Path) -> None:
    """Try to enhance analysis using advanced features if available."""
    try:
        from codebase_gardener.core import advanced_features_controller, check_advanced_features

        if not check_advanced_features():
            return

        enhanced_context = advanced_features_controller.enhance_analysis(self.analysis_results)
        # Seamlessly enhance results if features available

    except ImportError:
        # Advanced features not available - expected for MVP mode
        pass
```

## Handoff to Task 4: Enhanced CLI Interface Integration

### What Task 4 Should Implement

1. **CLI Flag Integration**
   - Add `--advanced` flag to `analyze` command
   - Implement mode detection and switching logic
   - Create user feedback mechanisms for feature availability

2. **User Experience Enhancement**
   - Mode detection: automatically determine best analysis mode
   - User feedback: show available features and enhancement levels
   - Progressive enhancement: seamlessly upgrade analysis when features available

3. **CLI Command Extensions**
   - Extend existing commands with advanced features
   - Maintain full backwards compatibility
   - Add help text for advanced features

### Ready-to-Use Infrastructure

**Advanced Features Controller:** Complete coordination system with feature detection ✅
**Component Registry:** All core components registered and available ✅
**CLI Integration Hooks:** Enhancement detection already integrated ✅
**Resource Monitoring:** Mac Mini M4 constraint checking operational ✅
**Graceful Fallbacks:** Complete fallback system for all components ✅

### Quick Wins for Task 4 (<30min)

1. **CLI Flag Addition** (15min) - Add `--advanced` argument parser to analyze command
2. **User Feedback Messages** (10min) - Add feature availability messages during analysis
3. **Mode Detection Logic** (10min) - Enhance existing enhancement level detection

### Deferred Items (Post-MVP)

- **Data Components:** Vector store and embedding generation (Phase 2 tasks)
- **Training Pipeline:** Full LoRA training implementation (Phase 3 tasks)
- **Web UI Integration:** Gradio interface connections (low priority)

## Success Validation Checklist

1. **AdvancedFeaturesController is the coordination hub** - All CLI enhancements should use this system
2. **Enhancement hooks are already integrated** - Task 4 should build on existing `_try_enhance_analysis()` method
3. **Feature availability detection is working** - Use `check_advanced_features()` for CLI flag behavior
4. **Resource monitoring is operational** - Leverage `get_resource_status()` for user feedback
5. **Graceful fallbacks are comprehensive** - All features work with fallback implementations

**Status:** Task 3 COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY ✅
**Next Task:** Task 4 - Enhanced CLI Interface Integration
**Estimated Task 4 Duration:** 45 minutes
**Critical Path:** CLI flag integration → User feedback mechanisms → Mode switching logic
