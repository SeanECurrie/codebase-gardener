- [x] Read `.kiro/steering/codebase-gardener-principles.md` - understand core principles and success metrics
- [x] Read `.kiro/steering/ai-ml-architecture-context.md` - understand technical architecture decisions

**Key Questions:**

- What are the specific requirements this task must fulfill?
- How does this task fit into the larger system architecture?
- What are the performance/quality constraints for this task?

#### Analysis of Project Vision:

**Core Concept**: Project-specific intelligence through specialized LoRA adapters. Each codebase gets its own "brain" trained on that project's patterns. The project switching paradigm is central - users switch between specialized contexts.

**Requirements Analysis for Task 13**:
- **Requirement 3**: Dynamic model loading and unloading for efficient project switching
  - WHEN switching projects THEN system SHALL unload current LoRA adapter and load new one
  - WHEN loading models THEN system SHALL verify adapter compatibility with base model
  - WHEN memory is constrained THEN system SHALL efficiently manage model loading/unloading
  - WHEN adapters fail to load THEN system SHALL fallback to base model with warnings
  - WHEN multiple rapid switches occur THEN system SHALL handle concurrent loading requests gracefully

**Architecture Fit**:
- This task implements the core dynamic loading mechanism mentioned in the design
- Integrates with PeftManager for actual adapter operations
- Coordinates with ProjectRegistry for project metadata
- Provides the foundation for project switching paradigm

**Performance Constraints**:
- Mac Mini M4 memory optimization (stay within 8GB constraints)
- Project switching should feel instant (<2 seconds)
- Dynamic loading/unloading to manage memory constraints
- Graceful degradation when system resources are constrained

### 3. Forward Compatibility Review
**Check upcoming tasks for expected interfaces:**
- [x] Read the next 3-5 tasks in `tasks.md` to understand what they expect from this task
- [x] Identify any interfaces, data formats, or patterns that future tasks will need
- [x] Note any dependencies that future tasks have on this task's output
- [x] Check if this task needs to prepare for future integrations

**Key Questions:**
- What will the next tasks expect this task to provide?
- Are there any interfaces this task should expose for future use?
- What data formats or structures should this task output for downstream tasks?
- Are there any extensibility requirements for future features?

#### Analysis of Future Tasks:

**Task 14 (Project Context Manager)**: Will need:
- Model loading status information for context switching decisions
- Integration with dynamic loader to coordinate model and context switching
- Notification when model loading completes for context activation

**Task 15 (Project-Specific Vector Stores)**: Will need:
- Coordination with model loading to ensure vector store and model are synchronized
- Model compatibility information for vector store optimization

**Task 16 (Gradio Project Selector)**: Will need:
- Model loading status for UI display
- Loading progress information for user feedback
- Error handling integration for loading failure display

#### Required Interfaces for Future Tasks:

1. **Loading Status Interface**: Real-time status updates for UI components
2. **Model Compatibility API**: Query interface for adapter compatibility with base models
3. **Loading Progress Events**: Notifications for loading progress and completion
4. **Error Reporting Interface**: Structured error information for UI display
