# Task 3: Production Environment Setup and Deployment Kit - 2025-01-08

## Approach Decision

After researching deployment best practices using MCP tools (systemd documentation, Docker Compose, and real-world Python deployment examples), I've decided on a **native systemd approach** for the Mac Mini M4 deployment:

### Why Systemd Over Docker Compose:
- **Memory Efficiency**: No Docker overhead on 8GB unified memory system
- **Resource Control**: Better integration with macOS system services and resource management
- **Thermal Management**: Direct process control for sustained workloads
- **Backup Simplicity**: File-based backup vs container complexity
- **Local-First Alignment**: Direct file system access for vector stores and models

### Architecture Overview:
```
Production Deployment Stack:
├── Ollama Service (systemd)
├── Codebase Gardener Service (systemd)
├── Installation Automation
├── Health Monitoring System
├── Backup & Recovery System
└── Operational Runbooks
```

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Service Architecture
- **Ollama Service**: Dedicated systemd service for LLM inference
- **Codebase Gardener Service**: Python application as systemd service
- **Dependency Services**: Vector store, monitoring, backup services

### 2. Installation Automation
- **System Dependencies**: Python, Ollama, system tools
- **Python Environment**: Virtual environment with all dependencies
- **Service Setup**: Automated systemd service installation and configuration
- **Validation Scripts**: Health checks and configuration validation

### 3. Production Configuration
- **Environment Templates**: Production-ready configuration files
- **Resource Limits**: Memory and CPU constraints for Mac Mini M4
- **Security Settings**: Service users, file permissions, access controls
- **Logging Configuration**: Structured logging with rotation

### 4. Monitoring & Health Checks
- **Service Health**: systemd-based service monitoring
- **Resource Monitoring**: Memory, CPU, disk usage tracking
- **Application Health**: Custom health check endpoints
- **Alerting**: Log-based alerting for critical issues

### 5. Backup & Recovery
- **Data Backup**: Vector stores, project data, conversation history
- **Model Backup**: LoRA adapters and base model configurations
- **Configuration Backup**: Service configurations and environment files
- **Recovery Procedures**: Automated restoration scripts

## Key Research Findings

### Systemd Best Practices:
- Use `Type=notify` for services that signal readiness
- Implement `Restart=on-failure` for automatic recovery
- Use dedicated service users for security
- Environment variables in unit files for configuration
- Proper dependency management with `After=` and `Wants=`

### Python Service Patterns:
- Unbuffered output with `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1`
- Signal handling for graceful shutdown
- Health check endpoints for monitoring
- Structured logging for operational visibility

### Mac Mini M4 Optimizations:
- Memory limits in systemd unit files
- CPU affinity for thermal management
- Disk I/O optimization for vector operations
- Background processing for model loading

## Implementation Plan

1. **Create Installation Scripts** - Automated dependency and service setup
2. **Develop Systemd Services** - Ollama and Codebase Gardener service files
3. **Build Configuration Templates** - Production environment configuration
4. **Implement Health Monitoring** - Service and resource monitoring
5. **Create Backup System** - Automated backup and recovery procedures
6. **Write Operational Runbooks** - Maintenance and troubleshooting guides
7. **Test Deployment** - Validate in clean environment

### Key Architectural Decisions

#### Native launchd vs Docker Approach
- **Chosen**: Native launchd services for better resource control
