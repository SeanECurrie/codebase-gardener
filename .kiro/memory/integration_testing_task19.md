- ⚠️ Persistence Testing → **Integrate**: End-to-end tests validate persistence
- ⚠️ Context Switching → **Integrate**: Project switching workflow tests validate this
- ⚠️ Memory Management → **Integrate**: Performance tests validate memory management

**Task 15 (Vector Stores) Gaps:**
- ⚠️ Real LanceDB Integration → **Integrate**: End-to-end tests need actual database operations
- ⚠️ Health Monitoring → **Quick validation**: Enhance system health monitoring
- ⚠️ Search Operations → **Quick validation**: Validate in integration tests
- ⚠️ Error Recovery → **Integrate**: Integration tests validate error recovery

**Task 16 (Gradio UI) Gaps:**

- Final architectural decision records and system overview

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **Real Model Integration**: Connect existing components (UI → ApplicationContext → OllamaClient + LoRA)
- **End-to-End Testing**: Complete workflows from project creation to analysis
- **Performance Validation**: Mac Mini M4 specific optimization testing
- **Documentation Strategy**: User, developer, and system documentation
- **Health Monitoring**: Comprehensive system status and diagnostics
