# Task 13: Dynamic Model Loader System - 2025-02-04

## Task Overview
- **Task Number**: 13
- **Component**: Dynamic Model Loader System
- **Date Started**: 2025-02-04
- **Date Completed**: 2025-02-04
- **Developer**: Kiro AI Assistant
- **Branch**: feat/dynamic-model-loader

## Approach Decision

### Problem Statement
Implement a dynamic model loader system for efficient LoRA adapter loading/unloading with memory management and model caching capabilities. The system must handle adapter compatibility verification, fallback mechanisms, and concurrent model loading while being optimized for Mac Mini M4 memory constraints.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Simple Adapter Loading/Unloading**:
   - Pros: Straightforward implementation, minimal complexity
   - Cons: No memory management, no caching, no optimization
   - Decision: Rejected - Insufficient for production-grade system requirements

2. **Basic Caching with Manual Management**:
   - Pros: Some performance improvement, moderate complexity
   - Cons: No automatic memory management, limited scalability
   - Decision: Rejected - Doesn't meet Mac Mini M4 optimization requirements

3. **Comprehensive Dynamic Loader with LRU Caching and Memory Management**:
   - Pros: Full memory optimization, automatic cache management, compatibility verification, fallback mechanisms
   - Cons: Higher implementation complexity, more integration points
   - Decision: Chosen - Best fit for project requirements and Mac Mini M4 constraints

### Chosen Approach
Implementing a comprehensive DynamicModelLoader class that provides:
- Dynamic loading/unloading of LoRA adapters with memory management
- LRU caching with configurable size limits (default: 3 adapters)
- Memory monitoring and constraint checking (4GB limit for Mac Mini M4)
- Adapter compatibility verification with base models
- Fallback mechanisms when adapters fail to load
- Thread-safe operations with proper locking
- Comprehensive metrics tracking and health monitoring
- Context manager support for temporary adapter usage

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **LRU Cache Architecture**: OrderedDict-based cache with automatic eviction
- **Memory Management**: Proactive memory monitoring with 4GB limit for Mac Mini M4
- **Thread Safety**: RLock for all shared state modifications
- **Base Model Management**: Single base model with dynamic adapter switching
- **Compatibility Verification**: PeftConfig-based compatibility checking
- **Fallback Strategy**: Continue with base model when adapter loading fails
- **Metrics Tracking**: Comprehensive performance and usage metrics

   - **Solution**: Used dependency injection and established patterns from previous tasks
   - **Time Impact**: 30 minutes adapting to existing interfaces and patterns
   - **Learning**: Good component design makes integration straightforward

### Code Patterns Established
```python
# Pattern 1: Thread-safe LRU cache with memory management
class DynamicModelLoader:
    def __init__(self):
        self._adapter_cache: OrderedDict[str, AdapterInfo] = OrderedDict()
        self._lock = threading.RLock()
        self._memory_limit_mb = 4096  # Mac Mini M4 constraint

    def _manage_cache(self) -> None:
        while len(self._adapter_cache) > self._max_cache_size:
            oldest_id, oldest_info = self._adapter_cache.popitem(last=False)
            # Clean up memory
```

```python
# Pattern 2: Memory-aware loading with compatibility verification
@retry_with_backoff(max_attempts=3)
def load_adapter(self, project_id: str, adapter_name: str = "default") -> bool:
    with self._lock:
        # Check memory availability
        if not self._check_memory_availability(estimated_size):
            self._manage_cache()

        # Verify compatibility
        if not self._verify_adapter_compatibility(adapter_path, base_model):
            logger.warning("Compatibility check failed, proceeding with fallback")

        # Load adapter with proper error handling
```

```python
# Pattern 3: Context manager for temporary adapter usage
@contextmanager
def adapter_context(self, project_id: str, adapter_name: str = "default"):
    was_loaded = adapter_id in self._adapter_cache
    try:
        success = self.load_adapter(project_id, adapter_name)
        yield self._adapter_cache[adapter_id].model if success else None
    finally:
        if not was_loaded:
            self.unload_adapter(project_id, adapter_name)
```

### Configuration Decisions
- **Max Cache Size**: 3 adapters - Balance between performance and memory usage
- **Memory Limit**: 4GB - Leave headroom for system operations on Mac Mini M4
- **Base Model**: microsoft/DialoGPT-medium - Reasonable size for testing and development
- **Estimated Adapter Size**: 50MB - Conservative estimate for LoRA adapters
- **Retry Attempts**: 3 - Consistent with established error handling patterns

### Dependencies Added
- **torch**: Already available - PyTorch backend for model operations and memory management
- **transformers**: Already available - Model loading and tokenizer management
- **peft**: Already available - LoRA adapter loading and management

## Integration Points

### How This Component Connects to Others
- **OllamaClient (Task 9)**: Coordinates with Ollama for base model inference
- **PeftManager (Task 10)**: Uses PEFT manager patterns for adapter management
- **ProjectRegistry (Task 11)**: Gets project metadata and adapter paths
- **Configuration System (Task 2)**: Uses Settings class for configuration parameters
- **Error Handling Framework (Task 4)**: Integrates with established exception hierarchy

### Dependencies and Interfaces
```python
# Input interfaces
from ..models.ollama_client import OllamaClient
from ..models.peft_manager import PeftManager
from ..core.project_registry import ProjectRegistry, get_project_registry

# Output interfaces
class DynamicModelLoader:
    def load_adapter(self, project_id: str, adapter_name: str = "default") -> bool
    def unload_adapter(self, project_id: str, adapter_name: str = "default") -> bool
    def switch_project(self, project_id: str, adapter_name: str = "default") -> bool
    def get_loaded_adapters(self) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]
    def get_metrics(self) -> LoaderMetrics
    def health_check(self) -> Dict[str, Any]
```

### Data Flow Considerations
1. **Input Data**: Project ID, adapter name, optional force reload flag
2. **Processing**: Memory checking → Base model loading → Adapter loading → Cache management
3. **Output Data**: Success/failure status, loaded adapter information, performance metrics

### Error Handling Integration
- **DynamicModelLoaderError**: Custom exception for loader-specific issues
- **Retry Logic**: Uses established retry patterns for transient failures
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues with base model when adapter loading fails
- **Resource Monitoring**: Checks memory availability before operations

## Testing Strategy

@patch('src.codebase_gardener.core.dynamic_model_loader.PeftModel')
@patch('src.codebase_gardener.core.dynamic_model_loader.AutoModelForCausalLM')
@patch('src.codebase_gardener.core.dynamic_model_loader.AutoTokenizer')
def test_load_adapter_success(self, mock_tokenizer, mock_model, mock_peft, loader):
    # Mock all external dependencies to isolate loader logic
    pass

# Mock path objects with proper exists() method
mock_path = Mock(spec=Path)
mock_path.exists.return_value = True
project.lora_adapter_path = mock_path
```

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
- **LRU Cache Architecture**: OrderedDict-based cache with move_to_end() provides efficient LRU management

- **Metrics Tracking**: Detailed performance metrics enable monitoring and optimization

### What Would Be Done Differently
- **Async Support**: Could implement async/await patterns for non-blocking operations
- **More Granular Memory Tracking**: Could implement per-adapter memory measurement instead of estimates
- **Advanced Caching**: Could implement more sophisticated caching strategies (e.g., frequency-based)
- **Model Quantization**: Could add support for model quantization to reduce memory usage

### Patterns to Reuse in Future Tasks
- **Thread-Safe LRU Cache**: OrderedDict with RLock pattern for efficient caching
