2. **Simple wrapper around PEFT with basic functionality**:
   - Pros: Some abstraction, easier than direct usage, moderate complexity
   - Cons: No advanced resource management, limited integration capabilities
   - Decision: Rejected - Doesn't meet Mac Mini M4 optimization requirements

3. **Comprehensive PEFT manager with resource management and integration**:
   - Pros: Full resource management, seamless integration, optimized for constraints
   - Cons: Higher implementation complexity, more dependencies
   - Decision: Chosen - Best fit for project requirements and architecture

### Chosen Approach
Implementing a comprehensive PeftManager class that provides:
- LoRA adapter creation and training with progress tracking
- Dynamic adapter loading/unloading for memory efficiency
- Integration with existing error handling and configuration systems
- Resource management optimized for Mac Mini M4 constraints
- Adapter registry for metadata and lifecycle management
- Training pipeline with asynchronous operations and checkpointing
- Comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **Manager Architecture**: Single PeftManager class with modular components

### Code Patterns Established
```python
# Pattern 1: Comprehensive PEFT manager with resource management
class PeftManager:
    def __init__(self, settings: Settings):
        self.settings = settings
        self._adapters_cache: Dict[str, PeftModel] = {}
        self._adapter_metadata: Dict[str, AdapterMetadata] = {}
        self._max_cache_size = 3  # Memory optimization
    
    @retry_with_backoff(max_attempts=3)
    def create_adapter(self, project_name: str, training_data: List[Dict]) -> str:
        # Implementation with error handling and retry logic
        pass
```

```python
# Pattern 2: Asynchronous training with progress tracking
def _train_adapter(self, adapter_id: str, base_model: str, training_data: List[Dict]) -> None:
    class ProgressTrainer(Trainer):
        def log(self, logs):
            super().log(logs)
            if self.progress_callback and self.state.global_step > 0:
                # Update progress tracking
                pass
```

```python
# Pattern 3: Context manager for temporary adapter loading
@contextmanager
def adapter_context(self, project_name: str, adapter_name: str = "default"):
    was_cached = adapter_id in self._adapters_cache
    try:
        model = self.load_adapter(project_name, adapter_name)
        yield model
    finally:
        if not was_cached:
            self.unload_adapter(project_name, adapter_name)
```

### Configuration Decisions
- **LoRA Rank (r)**: `16` - Good balance between adaptation capability and memory usage
- **LoRA Alpha**: `32` - 2:1 ratio with rank for optimal scaling

- **accelerate**: Already available - Distributed training and memory optimization

## Integration Points

### How This Component Connects to Others
- **Ollama Client**: Coordinates with Ollama for base model management and inference
- **Configuration System**: Uses Settings class for PEFT-specific configuration parameters
- **Error Handling Framework**: Integrates with CodebaseGardenerError hierarchy and retry patterns
- **Directory Setup**: Uses established ~/.codebase-gardener/projects/ directory structure

### Dependencies and Interfaces
```python
# Input interfaces
from codebase_gardener.config.settings import Settings
from codebase_gardener.utils.error_handling import CodebaseGardenerError, ModelError
from codebase_gardener.models.ollama_client import OllamaClient

# Output interfaces  
class PeftManager:
    def create_adapter(self, project_name: str, training_data: List[Dict]) -> str
    def load_adapter(self, project_name: str, adapter_name: str) -> bool
    def unload_adapter(self, adapter_name: str) -> bool
    def list_adapters(self, project_name: str) -> List[Dict]
    def delete_adapter(self, project_name: str, adapter_name: str) -> bool
```

### Data Flow Considerations
1. **Input Data**: Training data (code chunks with metadata), project configuration
2. **Processing**: LoRA adapter training, model adaptation, resource management
3. **Output Data**: Trained adapters, training metrics, adapter metadata

### Error Handling Integration
- **Error Types**: ModelError for PEFT-specific issues, TrainingError for training failures
- **Propagation**: Structured exceptions with context and recovery suggestions
- **Recovery**: Retry logic for transient failures, fallback to base model when needed

## Testing Strategy

### Test Cases Implemented
1. **Unit Tests**:
   - `test_initialization_success`: PeftManager initialization and directory setup
   - `test_create_adapter_success`: LoRA adapter creation with threading
   - `test_load_adapter_from_cache`: Adapter loading from memory cache
   - `test_unload_adapter_success`: Adapter memory cleanup
   - `test_list_adapters_with_data`: Adapter metadata listing and filtering

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - `test_train_adapter_success`: Complete training workflow with mocked dependencies
   - `test_adapter_context_manager`: Context manager for temporary loading
   - `test_memory_management`: Cache management and resource monitoring

3. **Error Handling Tests**:
   - `test_create_adapter_insufficient_memory`: Memory constraint handling
   - `test_load_adapter_not_found`: Missing adapter error handling
   - `test_training_error_propagation`: Training failure recovery

### Edge Cases Discovered
- **Memory Constraints**: System behavior when available memory < 2GB for training
- **Adapter Status Management**: Handling adapters in "training", "ready", and "error" states
- **Concurrent Training**: Multiple training operations and thread management
- **Cache Overflow**: Behavior when adapter cache exceeds memory limits
- **File System Errors**: Handling adapter storage and metadata persistence failures

### Performance Benchmarks
- **Memory Usage**: Target <4GB for PEFT operations, <1GB for adapter storage
- **Training Time**: Optimized for Mac Mini M4 with 4-bit quantization and batch size 4
- **Loading Time**: Adapter loading from disk <2 seconds for typical LoRA adapters
- **Cache Efficiency**: LRU cache with max 3 adapters to balance memory and performance

### Mock Strategies Used
```python
# Comprehensive mocking for training dependencies
@patch('src.codebase_gardener.models.peft_manager.AutoModelForCausalLM')
@patch('src.codebase_gardener.models.peft_manager.BitsAndBytesConfig')
@patch('src.codebase_gardener.models.peft_manager.LoraConfig')
@patch('src.codebase_gardener.models.peft_manager.Trainer')
def test_train_adapter_success(self, mock_trainer, mock_lora, mock_bits, mock_model):
    # Mock all external dependencies to isolate PEFT manager logic
    pass
```
