# Pre-Task Comprehensive Review for Task 10.2: HuggingFace PEFT Manager

## MANDATORY: Complete this review BEFORE starting any task implementation

### 1. Previous Tasks Integration Review
**Read and understand ALL completed tasks:**
- [x] Read ALL memory files in `.kiro/memory/` to understand what has been built
- [x] Identify interfaces, data structures, and patterns established by previous tasks
- [x] Note any integration points that this task must respect
- [x] Check for any assumptions or dependencies from previous implementations

**Key Questions:**
- What interfaces do previous tasks expect this task to provide?
- What data structures/formats must this task consume or produce?
- Are there established patterns this task should follow?
- What integration points were mentioned in previous memory files?

#### Analysis of Previous Tasks:

**Task 1 (Project Structure)**: Established src/codebase_gardener package structure with models/ module for AI/ML components. PEFT manager should be placed in `src/codebase_gardener/models/peft_manager.py`.

**Task 2 (Configuration/Logging)**: Established Pydantic BaseSettings with CODEBASE_GARDENER_ prefix and structured logging. PEFT manager must use `from codebase_gardener.config import settings` and `logger = structlog.get_logger(__name__)`.

**Task 3 (Directory Setup)**: Created ~/.codebase-gardener/ structure with base_models/ and projects/ directories. PEFT manager should store LoRA adapters in project-specific directories under projects/.

**Task 4 (Error Handling)**: Established custom exception hierarchy with ModelError and retry decorators. PEFT manager must use ModelError for training/loading failures and apply retry logic.

**Task 5 (Tree-sitter Parser)**: Provides CodeStructure and ParseResult for training data preparation. PEFT manager should integrate with parser output for training data generation.

**Task 6 (Preprocessing)**: Provides CodeChunk objects with metadata and complexity scores. PEFT manager should use CodeChunk objects as training data input.

**Task 7 (Nomic Embeddings)**: Established embedding patterns and caching. PEFT manager may need to coordinate with embedding generation for training data.

**Task 8 (LanceDB Storage)**: Provides vector storage for code chunks. PEFT manager should coordinate with vector store for training data retrieval.

**Task 9 (Ollama Client)**: Established OllamaClient for base model inference. PEFT manager must integrate with OllamaClient for LoRA adapter application and inference.

#### Expected Interfaces from Previous Tasks:
- **Configuration**: Use settings for model paths, training parameters, memory limits
- **Error Handling**: Use ModelError, retry decorators, structured logging
- **Data Input**: Accept CodeChunk objects from preprocessing system
- **Model Integration**: Coordinate with OllamaClient for base model + LoRA inference
- **Storage**: Use established directory structure for LoRA adapter storage

### 2. Project Goals and Architecture Review
**Read and understand the project vision:**
- [x] Read `.kiro/specs/codebase-gardener-mvp/requirements.md` - understand user stories and acceptance criteria
- [x] Read `.kiro/specs/codebase-gardener-mvp/design.md` - understand system architecture and data flow
- [x] Read `.kiro/steering/codebase-gardener-principles.md` - understand core principles and success metrics
- [x] Read `.kiro/steering/ai-ml-architecture-context.md` - understand technical architecture decisions

**Key Questions:**
- How does this task contribute to the overall project vision?
- What are the specific requirements this task must fulfill?
- How does this task fit into the larger system architecture?
- What are the performance/quality constraints for this task?

#### Analysis of Project Goals:

**Core Vision**: Create specialized AI assistants for individual codebases through LoRA adapters. PEFT manager is CRITICAL for this vision - it's responsible for training project-specific LoRA adapters.

**Requirement 2**: "LoRA adapter training pipeline for each codebase" - PEFT manager directly implements this requirement.
- Must automatically train LoRA adapters when new projects are added
- Must use HuggingFace PEFT for parameter-efficient fine-tuning
- Must extract meaningful code patterns for training data
- Must save adapters in project-specific directories
- Must provide fallback to base model when training fails

**Mac Mini M4 Constraints**: 
- Memory efficiency is CRITICAL - LoRA adapters should be 1-10MB vs 1-10GB full models
- Training should take minutes/hours, not days/weeks
- Must support dynamic loading/unloading of adapters
- Must optimize for unified memory architecture

**Local-First Processing**: All training must happen locally, no external API dependencies.

### 3. Forward Compatibility Review
**Check upcoming tasks for expected interfaces:**
- [x] Read the next 3-5 tasks in `tasks.md` to understand what they expect from this task
- [x] Identify any interfaces, data formats, or patterns that future tasks will need
- [x] Note any dependencies that future tasks have on this task's output
- [x] Check if this task needs to prepare for future integrations

**Key Questions:**
- What will the next tasks expect this task to provide?
- Are there any interfaces this task should expose for future use?
- What data formats or structures should this task output for downstream tasks?
- Are there any extensibility requirements for future features?

#### Analysis of Future Task Dependencies:

**Task 11 (Project Registry)**: Will need to track LoRA adapter training status and manage project lifecycle. PEFT manager must provide:
- Training status reporting (not_started, in_progress, completed, failed)
- Adapter metadata (model version, training date, performance metrics)
- Integration with project registration workflow

**Task 12 (LoRA Training Pipeline)**: Will orchestrate the training workflow. PEFT manager must provide:
- Training interface that can be called programmatically
- Progress reporting for training status
- Resource management to avoid memory issues
- Integration with automatic training when projects are added

**Task 13 (Dynamic Model Loader)**: Will load/unload LoRA adapters dynamically. PEFT manager must provide:
- Adapter compatibility verification with base models
- Standardized adapter file format and metadata
- Memory-efficient loading/unloading interfaces
- Fallback mechanisms when adapters fail to load

**Task 14 (Project Context Manager)**: Will coordinate project switching. PEFT manager must provide:
- Fast adapter switching capabilities
- Context preservation during adapter changes
- Integration with conversation state management

#### Required Interfaces for Future Tasks:
- **Training Interface**: `train_adapter(project_id, training_data, config)` 
- **Loading Interface**: `load_adapter(adapter_path)`, `unload_adapter()`
- **Status Interface**: `get_training_status(project_id)`, `get_adapter_info(adapter_path)`
- **Validation Interface**: `verify_adapter_compatibility(adapter_path, base_model)`

### 4. Development Standards Review

4. **Error Handling Integration**: Test that ModelError exceptions are properly raised and handled

**End-to-End Validation**:
1. **Training Workflow**: Train a small LoRA adapter on synthetic code data
2. **Inference Workflow**: Load adapter and verify it affects model responses
3. **Memory Management**: Verify training stays within Mac Mini M4 memory constraints
4. **Performance**: Verify training completes in reasonable time (minutes, not hours)

**Success Criteria**:
- LoRA adapter training completes successfully with synthetic data
- Trained adapter can be loaded and applied to base model
- Memory usage stays under 2GB during training
