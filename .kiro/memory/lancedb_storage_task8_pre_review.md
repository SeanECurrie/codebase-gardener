**Architecture Context (from ai-ml-architecture-context.md)**:
- Multi-tenant architecture with separate vector stores per project
- Similarity search within project-specific embeddings
- Metadata filtering by file type, function type, complexity
- Memory allocation: ~500MB for vector store cache

**Performance Constraints**:
- Mac Mini M4 optimization with 8GB memory constraint
- Local-first processing (no external dependencies)

**Key Questions:**
- What will the next tasks expect this task to provide?
- Are there any interfaces this task should expose for future use?
- What data formats or structures should this task output for downstream tasks?
- Are there any extensibility requirements for future features?

#### Analysis of Future Task Dependencies:

**Task 11 (Project Registry)**:
- Will need vector store initialization and cleanup for project lifecycle
- Expects project-specific vector store management
- Needs fast lookup capabilities for project metadata

**Task 13 (Dynamic Model Loader)**:
- May need vector store state management during model switching
- Expects efficient loading/unloading of project-specific stores

**Task 14 (Project Context Manager)**:
- Will need vector store switching for project context changes
- Expects conversation context integration with vector search

**Task 15 (Project-Specific Vector Store Management)**:
- Directly builds on this task's foundation
- Expects multi-tenant vector store architecture
- Needs project isolation and data management

**Task 17 (Gradio Web Interface)**:
- Will need similarity search capabilities for user queries
- Expects real-time search performance for UI responsiveness

#### Required Interfaces for Future Tasks:
1. **VectorStore class** with project-specific initialization

2. **Project Lifecycle**: Create project store → Add vectors → Search → Cleanup
3. **Multi-Project**: Multiple project stores with data isolation
4. **Performance**: Search latency and throughput benchmarks

**Success Criteria**:
