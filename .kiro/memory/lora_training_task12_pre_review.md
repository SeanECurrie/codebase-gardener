### 2. Project Goals and Architecture Review
**Read and understand the project vision:**
- [x] Read `.kiro/specs/codebase-gardener-mvp/requirements.md` - understand user stories and acceptance criteria
- [x] Read `.kiro/specs/codebase-gardener-mvp/design.md` - understand system architecture and data flow
- [x] Read `.kiro/steering/codebase-gardener-principles.md` - understand core principles and success metrics
- [x] Read `.kiro/steering/ai-ml-architecture-context.md` - understand technical architecture decisions

**Key Questions:**
- How does this task contribute to the overall project vision?
- What are the specific requirements this task must fulfill?
- How does this task fit into the larger system architecture?
- What are the performance/quality constraints for this task?

#### Analysis of Project Vision:

**Core Concept**: Project-specific intelligence through specialized LoRA adapters. Each codebase gets its own "brain" trained on that project's patterns.

**Requirements Analysis for Task 12**:
- **Requirement 2**: LoRA adapter training pipeline for each codebase
  - WHEN adding a new project THEN system SHALL automatically train a LoRA adapter
  - WHEN training LoRA adapters THEN system SHALL use HuggingFace PEFT
  - WHEN processing training data THEN system SHALL extract meaningful code patterns
  - WHEN training completes THEN system SHALL save adapter in project-specific directory
  - WHEN training fails THEN system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback

**Architecture Fit**:
- This task implements the automatic training workflow mentioned in the design
- Integrates with PeftManager (Task 10) for actual LoRA training operations
- Uses ProjectRegistry (Task 11) for status tracking and metadata management
- Consumes preprocessed CodeChunk objects (Task 6) as training data

**Performance Constraints**:
- Mac Mini M4 memory optimization (stay within 8GB constraints)
- Background training that doesn't interfere with active analysis
- Resource monitoring and graceful degradation under constraints

- [x] Identify any interfaces, data formats, or patterns that future tasks will need
- [x] Note any dependencies that future tasks have on this task's output
- [x] Check if this task needs to prepare for future integrations

**Key Questions:**
- What will the next tasks expect this task to provide?
- Are there any interfaces this task should expose for future use?
- What data formats or structures should this task output for downstream tasks?
- Are there any extensibility requirements for future features?

#### Analysis of Future Tasks:

**Task 13 (Dynamic Model Loader)**: Will need:
