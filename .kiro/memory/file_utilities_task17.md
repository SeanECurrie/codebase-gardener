# Task 17: File Utilities and Helper Functions - 2025-02-05

## Task Overview
- **Task Number**: 17
- **Component**: File Utilities and Helper Functions
- **Date Started**: 2025-02-05
- **Date Completed**: [To be completed]
- **Developer**: Kiro AI Assistant
- **Branch**: feat/file-utilities

## Approach Decision

### Problem Statement
Implement comprehensive file utilities and helper functions to support the codebase gardener's file system operations. The system needs file type detection, size calculation, directory traversal utilities, safe file operations with atomic operations, file monitoring and change detection, cross-platform path handling, and file filtering with exclusion patterns. This component must integrate with existing directory_setup.py to avoid duplication while extending functionality.

### Gap Validation Phase Analysis
From Task 16 completion test log, identified gaps that align with current scope:
- ⚠️ **File Upload**: No interface for adding new projects through UI → **Integrate**: File utilities will enable project creation from file system
- ⚠️ **Real Model Inference**: Need actual model integration → **Not applicable**: File utilities don't directly address model inference
- ⚠️ **Embedding Generation**: Need actual embedding pipeline → **Quick validation**: File utilities can support embedding pipeline file operations

Gap closure plan: Implement file utilities that enable project creation and management through the UI, supporting the embedding pipeline with robust file operations.

### Alternatives Considered
1. **Extend directory_setup.py directly**:
   - Pros: Single file, no new imports, simple approach
   - Cons: Violates single responsibility principle, makes directory_setup.py too complex
   - Decision: Rejected - Better to create complementary utilities

2. **Create separate file_utils.py with comprehensive utilities**:
   - Pros: Clean separation of concerns, focused functionality, extensible design
   - Cons: Additional module, need to coordinate with existing patterns
   - Decision: Chosen - Best balance of functionality and maintainability

3. **Use external library like fsspec**:
   - Pros: Comprehensive functionality, well-tested, cross-platform
   - Cons: Additional dependency, overkill for POC, learning curve
   - Decision: Rejected - Violates simplicity-first principle

### Chosen Approach
Creating a comprehensive FileUtilities class that complements DirectoryManager from Task 3. The approach provides:
- File type detection beyond simple extension mapping
- Safe file operations with atomic operations and error handling
- Directory traversal with filtering and exclusion patterns
- Cross-platform path handling and normalization
- File monitoring and change detection capabilities
- Integration with existing error handling and logging systems

### Key Architectural Decisions
- **Complementary Design**: Extend rather than replace directory_setup.py functionality
- **Class-Based Architecture**: FileUtilities class with organized method groups
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Use pathlib.Path for all operations with OS-specific handling
- **Error Handling Integration**: Use existing error handling framework and custom exceptions
- **Atomic Operations**: Safe file operations with backup and rollback capabilities
- **Pragmatic Implementation**: Focus on essential functionality first, advanced features later

## Research Findings

- Implement comprehensive error handling with graceful degradation
- Support both synchronous and asynchronous patterns where appropriate
- Use generator patterns for memory-efficient directory traversal
- Implement proper file locking and concurrent access handling

## Implementation Notes

### Specific Challenges Encountered
1. **Challenge 1**: Encoding detection complexity with UTF-16 BOM issues
   - **Solution**: Simplified encoding detection to focus on common encodings (utf-8, latin-1, cp1252) and added UnicodeError handling
   - **Time Impact**: 20 minutes debugging test failures and refining encoding detection logic
   - **Learning**: File encoding detection should prioritize common encodings and handle edge cases gracefully

2. **Challenge 2**: Test mocking for pathlib.Path operations
   - **Solution**: Used @patch('pathlib.Path.open') instead of @patch('builtins.open') for proper mocking of Path methods
   - **Time Impact**: 15 minutes adjusting test mocks and error handling scenarios
   - **Learning**: pathlib.Path methods need specific mocking approaches different from built-in functions

3. **Challenge 3**: Cross-platform path handling and hidden file detection
   - **Solution**: Implemented OS-specific logic for Windows hidden files while maintaining Unix-style dot file detection
   - **Time Impact**: 10 minutes implementing cross-platform compatibility patterns
   - **Learning**: Cross-platform file operations require careful consideration of OS-specific behaviors

### Code Patterns Established
```python
# Pattern 1: Multi-layered file type detection
def detect_file_type(self, file_path: Path) -> FileType:
    # Check by extension first (fastest)
    extension = file_path.suffix.lower()
    if extension in self.SOURCE_CODE_EXTENSIONS:
        return FileType.SOURCE_CODE

    # Use MIME type detection (reliable)
    mime_type, _ = self._mime_types.guess_type(str(file_path))
    if mime_type and mime_type.startswith('text/'):
        return FileType.TEXT

    # Fallback to content-based detection (thorough)
    if file_path.stat().st_size < 1024 * 1024:  # 1MB limit
        with file_path.open('rb') as f:
            sample = f.read(1024)
            return FileType.BINARY if b'\x00' in sample else FileType.TEXT
```

```python
# Pattern 2: Atomic file operations with backup and rollback
def atomic_write_file(self, file_path: Path, content: str, backup: bool = True) -> None:
    backup_path = None
    if backup and file_path.exists():
        backup_path = self.create_backup(file_path)

    temp_path = file_path.with_suffix(file_path.suffix + '.tmp')
    try:
        with temp_path.open('w', encoding=encoding) as f:
            f.write(content)
        temp_path.replace(file_path)  # Atomic move
    except Exception as e:
        if temp_path.exists():
            temp_path.unlink()
        if backup_path and backup_path.exists():
            backup_path.replace(file_path)  # Restore backup
        raise
```

```python
# Pattern 3: Memory-efficient directory traversal with filtering
def scan_directory(self, dir_path: Path, patterns: Optional[List[str]] = None,
                  recursive: bool = True, include_hidden: bool = False) -> Iterator[Path]:
    for pattern in patterns or ['*']:
        files = dir_path.rglob(pattern) if recursive else dir_path.glob(pattern)
        for file_path in files:
            if file_path.is_file():
                if not include_hidden and self.is_hidden_file(file_path):
                    continue
                yield file_path
```

```python
# Pattern 4: Cross-platform hidden file detection
def is_hidden_file(self, file_path: Path) -> bool:
    # Unix-style hidden files (start with dot)
    if file_path.name.startswith('.'):
        return True

    # Windows hidden files
    if os.name == 'nt':
        try:
            import ctypes
            attrs = ctypes.windll.kernel32.GetFileAttributesW(str(file_path))
            return attrs != -1 and attrs & 2  # FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN
        except (AttributeError, OSError):
            pass

    return False
```

### Configuration Decisions
- **File Type Detection**: Use both extension and content-based detection
- **Default Encoding**: UTF-8 with fallback detection
- **Atomic Operations**: Temporary file + atomic move pattern
- **Error Handling**: Custom exceptions with structured logging
- **Cross-Platform**: pathlib.Path with OS-specific handling where needed
