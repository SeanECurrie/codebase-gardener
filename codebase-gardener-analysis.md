Here's a high-level overview of the code structure and organization in the provided files.

**Data Processing and Storage**

*   The `data` package is responsible for handling code parsing, processing, and storage.
*   It contains sub-packages for different tasks, such as:
    *   `parser`: Handles code parsing using Tree-sitter for multiple programming languages.
    *   `preprocessor`: Provides a layer-2 system for transforming parsed AST structures into semantically meaningful code chunks with metadata.
    *   `vector_store`: Manages project-specific vector stores with data isolation, efficient switching, and health monitoring.

**Multi-Language Code Parser**

*   The `parser` package uses Tree-sitter to parse source code and extract structure.
*   It provides classes for handling different languages, such as Python, JavaScript, and TypeScript.

**Code Preprocessing and Chunking**

*   The `preprocessor` package implements a layer-2 system for transforming parsed AST structures into semantically meaningful code chunks with metadata.
*   It contains classes for handling various aspects of chunk generation, including:
    *   `ChunkType`: Represents different types of code chunks (e.g., function, class, method).
    *   `CodeChunk`: A data structure representing a single code chunk.

**Project-Specific Vector Store Management**

*   The `project_vector_store` package is responsible for managing project-specific vector stores.
*   It provides classes and functions for:
    *   `ProjectVectorStoreInfo`: Holds information about a specific vector store, including its table name and health status.
    *   `ProjectVectorStoreManager`: Manages multiple vector stores with data isolation, efficient switching, and health monitoring.

**Global Instance Management**

*   The global instance management allows access to the singleton instance of the project vector store manager.
*   This is achieved using a lock-based approach to ensure thread safety during concurrent access.

Overall, the code structure reflects a hierarchical organization, with each package building upon the previous one to provide a robust and modular system for handling various aspects of data processing and storage.
