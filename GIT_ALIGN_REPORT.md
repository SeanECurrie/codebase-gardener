### Potential Cleanup Commands (NOT EXECUTED - FOR REFERENCE ONLY)
```bash
# No branches require cleanup at this time
# All branches are current and active

# When branches become stale, these commands could be used:
# git branch -d <branch-name>  # for merged branches
# git branch -D <branch-name>  # for unmerged branches
# git push origin --delete <branch-name>  # remove remote branch
```

## Recommendations
1. Sync main branch with remote origin/main
2. Push MVP work to remote ✅ COMPLETED
3. Consider creating develop branch for ongoing work ✅ COMPLETED
4. Clean up feature branches after merging (none to clean up currently)
5. Monitor branch age and clean up after feature completion
