description: Comprehensive code review for correctness, readability, maintainability, and test coverage
---
Please perform a structured review of the current working tree:

1) High-risk issues (bugs, undefined behavior, race conditions)
2) Architecture consistency (layering, boundaries, dependency direction)
3) Readability & clarity (naming, dead code, duplication)
4) Tests (missing cases, flaky areas)
5) Tooling (lint, types, build warnings)
6) Actionable patch suggestions (minimal diffs)

Respect our conventions in CLAUDE.md and ONLY propose changes that fit them.
