description: Reconfirm MVP scope and de-scope bloat
---
Using repo context and README, list the 3–5 essential user journeys this MVP must support. Flag files/dirs that look out-of-scope or over-engineered. Propose a minimal next slice to ship in ≤1 day, and a tiny cut-list (what to delete or postpone). Output:

1. Must-have user journeys
2. Cut-list (files/dirs or features)
3. 1-day plan (tasks + commands)
