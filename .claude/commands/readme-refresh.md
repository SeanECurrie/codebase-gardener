description: Keep README the single source of truth
---
Open README.* (or create README.md if missing). Ensure it has: Name, Purpose, Quickstart (install/run/test in â‰¤10 lines), Minimal config (env vars), Folder map, MVP scope, Roadmap (Now/Next/Later). Write any missing sections and update commands so they actually work. Keep under 120 lines. Then stage changes.
