description: Create a clean starter structure
---
If repo is empty or messy, propose and create minimal structure:

- src/, tests/, scripts/, .env.example, .editorconfig, README.md, CHANGELOG.md

Use the simplest toolchain already present (npm/pnpm/yarn OR pip/poetry/uv) and wire scripts for: dev, test, lint, format.
Only add what's necessary to run, test, and format. No frameworks unless required by existing files. Update README Quickstart accordingly.
