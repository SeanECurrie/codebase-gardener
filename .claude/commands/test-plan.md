description: Tiny test plan and first 3 tests
---
Generate a 1â€‘page test plan covering: critical paths, error cases, and one integration check. Add 3 minimal tests for the riskiest path. If no test runner is configured, add the smallest runner for this stack and wire npm test or pytest -q. Keep diffs small and runnable.
