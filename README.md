# Codebase Gardener MVP üå±

AI-powered project-specific codebase analysis through specialized LoRA adapters.

## Overview

Codebase Gardener creates **specialized AI assistants** for individual codebases, not generic code analysis tools. Each codebase gets its own "brain" - a LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) adapter trained specifically on that project's patterns, conventions, and context.

### Core Concept: Project-Specific Intelligence

- **Specialized LoRA Adapters**: Each project gets its own LoRA adapter trained on that codebase's unique patterns
- **Project Switching**: Switch between different specialized AI assistants via a dropdown interface
- **Local-First Processing**: All processing happens locally on your Mac Mini M4 for privacy and control
- **Context Awareness**: Each project maintains its own conversation history and analysis state

## Features

- üß† **Project-Specific AI**: LoRA adapters trained on individual codebases
- üîÑ **Dynamic Model Loading**: Efficient switching between project-specific models
- üè† **Local Processing**: Complete privacy with local Ollama integration
- üåê **Web Interface**: Gradio-based UI for easy project switching and analysis
- üîç **Vector Search**: LanceDB-powered semantic code search
- üìä **Multi-Language Support**: Tree-sitter parsing for Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and more
- ‚ö° **Mac Mini M4 Optimized**: Efficient resource utilization for Apple Silicon

## Quick Start
### Single-file Auditor Quickstart (Task 2 & 3)

For a minimal, working auditor with interactive CLI:

```bash
# Optional: create a minimal venv
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install ollama

# Ensure Ollama is running and you have a model
ollama serve &
ollama pull llama3.2:3b  # lightweight, reliable model

# Optional: select host/model
export OLLAMA_HOST=http://localhost:11434
export OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.2:3b

# Run the interactive auditor
python codebase_auditor.py
```

**Interactive Commands:**
```
üîç > help                              # Show all commands
üîç > analyze ./my-project               # Analyze a codebase directory  
üîç > status                             # Show analysis summary and files
üîç > chat What are the main issues?     # Ask questions about the code
üîç > export my-analysis.md              # Export markdown report
üîç > quit                               # Exit the auditor
```

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ **Context-aware analysis**: Different analysis depth based on project size
- ‚úÖ **Smart file filtering**: Automatically excludes dependencies and build files
- ‚úÖ **Real-time progress**: Visual feedback during analysis with file counts
- ‚úÖ **Conversational Q&A**: Ask questions about your codebase after analysis
- ‚úÖ **Markdown reports**: Export detailed analysis for documentation
- ‚úÖ **Status tracking**: See which files were analyzed and processing stats

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Analyzing a Small Project (3-5 files)
```bash
üîç > analyze ./my-small-project
üìä Analysis Summary: 3/3 files, 1,247 bytes processed

üîç > chat What does this code do?
üí≠ Response: This appears to be a simple utility project with a main.py file 
that defines a greeting function, a utils.py with helper classes, and a README. 
The code is straightforward and well-organized for its scope.

üîç > export small-project-analysis.md
üìÑ Report exported to: small-project-analysis.md
```

### Example 2: Analyzing a Medium Project (20-40 files)  
```bash
üîç > analyze ./my-web-app
üìä Analysis Summary: 28/28 files, 156,789 bytes processed

üîç > status
‚úÖ üìä Analysis Summary: 28/28 files, 156,789 bytes processed
üìÅ Files analyzed: 28 files
   - src/components/Header.tsx
   - src/pages/Dashboard.tsx
   - src/utils/api.ts
   - package.json
   - ... and 24 more files

üîç > chat What are the main architectural patterns used?
üí≠ Response: This React application follows a component-based architecture with:
- **Component Structure**: Organized in src/components/ with reusable UI elements
- **Page Routing**: Next.js pages in src/pages/ for different app sections  
- **API Layer**: Centralized API utilities in src/utils/api.ts
- **State Management**: Uses React hooks for local state management
```

### Example 3: Analyzing a Large Project (100+ files)
```bash
üîç > analyze ./enterprise-app
üìä Analysis Summary: 247/312 files, 1,891,456 bytes processed

üîç > chat What are the strategic recommendations for this codebase?
üí≠ Response: **System Overview**: This is a multi-service enterprise application 
with microservices architecture. **Key Recommendations**: 
1. Consolidate duplicate authentication logic across services
2. Implement centralized logging and monitoring
3. Standardize API response formats between services
4. Consider breaking down the largest monolith service into smaller components
```

### Analysis Depth by Project Size

The auditor automatically adjusts analysis depth:

- **Small projects (‚â§5 files)**: Brief purpose and structure analysis
- **Medium projects (6-100 files)**: Comprehensive architectural analysis  
- **Large projects (>100 files)**: High-level strategic overview

## What This Tool Does and Doesn't Do

### ‚úÖ What It Does Well
- **Architectural Analysis**: Excellent at identifying modular structure and component relationships
- **Clean Projects**: Works best on well-organized codebases with clear structure  
- **Multiple Languages**: Supports Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Go, Rust, and more
- **Context Awareness**: Adjusts analysis depth automatically based on project size
- **File Filtering**: Smart exclusion of dependencies, build files, and virtual environments

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations  
- **Dependency-Heavy Projects**: May struggle with projects that have many external dependencies
- **Large Binary Files**: Cannot analyze compiled code or large data files effectively
- **Real-Time Updates**: Analysis is point-in-time, doesn't track changes over time
- **Domain Expertise**: General code analysis, not specialized for specific frameworks
- **File Access Issues**: May have trouble with permission-restricted or timeout-prone files

### üîß When to Use Other Tools
- **For detailed debugging**: Use IDE tools or debuggers for step-through analysis
- **For performance profiling**: Use specialized profilers for performance bottlenecks  
- **For security audits**: Use dedicated security scanners for vulnerability detection
- **For code formatting**: Use language-specific linters and formatters
- **For real-time collaboration**: Use IDE extensions or collaborative development tools

### üí° Best Results With
- **Clean, organized codebases** with clear directory structure
- **Projects between 10-100 files** for optimal analysis depth
- **Source code repositories** rather than compiled distributions
- **Well-documented projects** where README matches actual code

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Model check warning (continuing anyway)"**
- This is normal - the auditor will continue and work fine
- To fix: Ensure Ollama is running with `ollama serve`

**"No analysis completed yet"**  
- Run `analyze <directory>` command first before using `chat` or `export`
- Check that the directory path exists and contains source files

**Analysis includes too many dependency files**
- The tool automatically excludes `.venv`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__` etc.
- If still seeing unwanted files, they may be in non-standard locations

**Timeout errors when reading files**
- Usually happens with very large files or restricted access
- The analysis will continue with other files

### Performance Tips
- Projects with 10-100 files give the best analysis quality
- For very large projects, focus on specific subdirectories
- Clean up build artifacts and dependencies before analysis
