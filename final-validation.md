**Analysis Summary**

This codebase appears to be a minimal test project for an AI agent. The files provided are a brief introduction, a utility class, and a simple function.

**What the Code Does (Main Purpose/Functionality)**

The main purpose of this codebase is to provide a basic framework for testing an AI agent. The `hello` function in `main.py` returns a hardcoded string "world", while the `Utils` class in `utils.py` serves no purpose and can be removed.

**Basic Structure and Organization**

1. **README.md**: A good practice is to include a brief description of the project, its purpose, or any dependencies required.
2. **utils.py**: The file organization could be improved by including docstrings for the class and methods, if applicable.
3. **main.py**: The code is concise but lacks a clear explanation of what it does.

**Obvious Issues or Improvements Needed**

1. **Unused Code**: Remove the empty `Utils` class in `utils.py`.
2. **Functionality**: Consider adding more functionality to the AI agent by integrating this simple function into the project.
3. **Documentation**: Provide more context and explanation about the project, its purpose, and any dependencies required.
4. **Code Quality**: Ensure code organization and structure are consistent throughout the files.

**Recommendations**

1. Refactor `utils.py` to remove the empty class and consider adding relevant methods or functions if needed.
2. Enhance the functionality of the AI agent by integrating this simple function into the project.
3. Improve documentation for the README.md file, including any dependencies required or context about the project.

**Codebase Size**: The codebase is too small to provide a comprehensive review, but it's essential to focus on the provided files and make recommendations accordingly.
